So you think you know all about it? Take a look below at 10 reasons to visit Paris in 2017!
                        

                        1. Take advantage of the winter and summer sales to go on a shopping spree at La VilletteSituated in the 4th bay of the Cité des Sciences et de l’Industrie, Vill’Up is a new modern and trendy 30,000 m² shopping centre with shops and entertainment! At the heart of the lively La Villette canal basin (10 million visitors per year), the centre houses some forty or so shops (fashion, beauty, home decor, culture …). For fashionistas, there are cutting edge and creative labels, from the most in vogue streets of eastern Paris, like Karl Marc John, Nina Mendoza, or Petit Pan, not-to-be-missed brands like Cultura, and a shopping gallery that sells items that are both ethical and ecological and created by independent designers (fine food, jewellery, leatherwear goods …). On the food scene, discover 10 great food concepts, from traditional Italian cooking to the healthy menu at Yellow’s, not forgetting the delicious burgers at Memphis Burger. Above the atrium is a 16-screen Pathé cinema. And for an adrenaline rush, don’t miss the 14-metre-high glass tube, a free-fall simulator, in the middle of the shopping centre!2. Enjoy the romance of Paris with a magical gastronomic experienceWhen you come to Paris, don’t forget to call in at the magnificent Palace of Versailles. The newly-renovated Pavillon Dufour is home to Ore, the gastronomic restaurant of starred chef Alain Ducasse. Sample the cuisine of this world-renowned chef in a prestigious setting, throughout the day. This unique place, a delightful contemporary cafe in the daytime and an exceptional restaurant in the evening, is a perfect showcase for French art de vivre with a breathtaking view of the Royal Courtyard. The venue is available for partial or full private hire, for up to 124 people. An unforgettable experience.3. Plan an event at the heart of the first eco-responsible parisian spaceThe Fondation GoodPlanet - Domaine de Longchamp, an impressive eco-responsible event venue working in partnership with the Noctis Group, consists of a 2,400 m² chateau (450 people) comprising two pavilions (400 m² and 800 m²) and a medieval tower. Situated in the middle of the Bois de Boulogne, it is dedicated to tackling ecological challenges and the challenges of living together in a better way. Awareness of these issues is raised through a programme of art events, educational and country itineraries, as well as accessible food (cooking schools, food trucks).The chateau has a large room (506 m²) on the ground floor that can accommodate up to 900 people, with an adjoining terrace (200 m²). The first and second floors have large galleries presenting numerous works of art. On the first floor, a 80-seat auditorium is available for your conferences. Around the venue is a wooded 3.5 acre park, surrounded by a water course. There is also a fully-modular outdoor space (1,000 m²) for your events.  What’s more, on sunny days, the Clairière (a huge green space that can accomodate 1600 people) provides a ‘rustic’ lounge space, an area with a bar/food trucks, and a stage area with sound and lighting.4.Treat yourself to a complete change of scene in spring, in harmony with natureA place to reconnect with nature and others whilst enjoying all the attractions of Paris and its region.
