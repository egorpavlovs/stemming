Well, look again! The year 2019 promises to be just as exciting with new things and experiences lined up.

Attend top international eventsDid you know that more than 300 events take place every day in the French capital? Sporting and cultural events, festivities and professional or general public trade shows bring the city to life on a daily basis and contribute to its reputation.Among the hundreds of trade shows that will be held in Paris in 2019 are the inimitable Maison & Objet, the International Paris Air Show, and the Mondial du Bâtiment. These three shows previously attracted more than 800,000 visitors in total! Maison & Objet, the leading event for interior decoration and design professionals, will take place from 18 to 22 January and from 6 to 10 September at Paris Nord Villepinte; a venue that will also host the Mondial du Bâtiment, comprising the Batimat, interclima+Elec and Idéobain trade shows, from 4 to 8 November. The 53rd edition of the International Paris Air Show will be held from 17 to 23 June at Le Bourget.Note: Paris has also been chosen to host the 2019 edition of the ESC Congress - European Society of Cardiology, from 31 August to 4 September; it is the world's leading cardiovascular congress, with more than 30,000 medical professionals from more than 140 countries!In terms of sport, the Parc des Princes will host 7 of the FIFA Women's World Cup matches, including the opening match on 7 June.

This year again, Paris will have many new and reopened places ready to host your meetings, seminars and receptions.The Châteauform’ group will inaugurate two new venues: in March, Châteauform' City Newtown, an avant-garde address in the heart of the bustling Saint Ouen flea market district, with modular rooms designed to be conducive to working creatively (up to 60 participants); and in June, Châteauform' City Liège, a smart town house near Saint-Lazare station, with 8 meeting rooms, 4 private lofts and a magnificent indoor courtyard.The Palais des Congrès d’Issy has had a complete makeover and now offers a modern venue with enhanced period elements such as stained glass, metal decor and mosaics. This 1932 art deco establishment has 11 meeting rooms, a 930-seat amphitheatre and two multipurpose spaces of 390 and 627 m², for a total of 3,000 m² available for private hire.Disney Business Solutions, in the heart of Disneyland Paris, has a new meeting space within Disney's Newport Bay Club Convention Centre. 14 modular lounges from 44 to 70 m², around a vast 1,150 m² foyer, accommodate your conventions, seminars or plenary sessions. These are in addition to the Centre's 20 meeting rooms and 1,770 m² ballroom.  Finally, Paris Expo Porte de Versailles continues its transformation following the renovation of pavillons 1 and 4 and pavillon 7, where the Paris Convention Centre is located. During this second phase of work, due to be completed this year, pavillon 6 will be covered with a structure designed by the famous architect Jean Nouvel, from which will be suspended a multitude of illuminated messages relating to current and future events. It will have 250 m² of meeting room space, more than 15,000 m² of exhibition space, and a 14,000 m² urban farm on its roof with a greenhouse for events, a 370 m² room for private hire, and a catering area.3. Enjoy a vibrant hotel sceneParis with its 120,000 hotel rooms, spread over more than 2,000 establishments, is one of the leading capitals in terms of hotel capacity. Today, more than half of all overnight stays are related to business tourism; a figure that has been rising steadily in recent years.It is with this in mind that the work on the Porte de Versailles, mentioned previously, will also include two hotels - a Mama Shelter and a Novotel - with restaurant and a terrace with a bar for 2019, both designed by Jean-Michel Wilmotte. The 200-room Mama Shelter, faithful to the brand’s vibe, will offer a trendy and relaxed atmosphere, while Novotel 4* will have 246 rooms.Also in the south of Paris, a Jo&Joe (AccorHotels) hotel will open its doors in Gentilly, in March. The first hotel to be awarded the ‘Bâtiment Bas Carbone’ (‘low carbon building’) label, this hotel with an ‘open house’ concept is a hybrid establishment (a cross between a private rental and a youth hostel), with trendy decoration featuring street art. 569 beds will be available, as well as a bar, a restaurant, an indoor garden and several terraces. In line with new hotel concepts, and following the opening of a first establishment in Paris at Porte de Versailles in 2017, two Okko brand hotels will open at Gare de l'Est and Montparnasse.As for luxury hotels, they are not to be outdone and experienced a noticeable move upmarket between 2014 and 2018, with an increase of 8.4% in 4* hotel rooms and 25.3% for 5* hotel rooms. This trend is illustrated by the arrival in the capital of exquisite little hotels, such as Brach, next to the Eiffel Tower and Trocadéro, designed by Philippe Starck; the establishment offers 59 guest rooms, including 7 suites with a terrace overlooking the rooftops of the city, a sports club, a spa with a swimming pool and a 160-cover restaurant.Le Fouquet's completes a series of renovation work this year with 19 additional guest rooms and suites, offering the most beautiful views of the Champs-Elysées. And the Crowne Plaza République will be taking the wraps off its new look after several months of complete renovation.4. Taste sublime French cuisineIt is impossible to talk about the City of Light without mentioning gastronomy! Classified by Unesco since 2010 as an intangible cultural heritage, the French gourmet meal is an ongoing feast. In 2019, rediscover Paris’s inimitable brasseries! La Coupole, an establishment well known in the Montparnasse district for its splendid decor and listed pillars, unveils a new menu, with an emphasis on dishes that made it so successful in the 1920s. Le Dancing, a renowned club downstairs at the brasserie, has been refurbished and now offers a new programme with, for example, dinner shows on Friday and Saturday evenings. The restaurant can be privately hired for up to 350 people.The Brasserie La Lorraine is taking on a new lease of life for its 100th anniversary this year with an art deco atmosphere signed Laura Gonzalez. Two spaces are available for private use: the Rotonde (55 people) and the Private Room (20 people).For a taste of haute gastronomy, three-starred chef Alain Ducasse has opened a chic address: Ducasse sur Seine (146 covers), a 100%-electric boat offering a cruise with a stop in front of the Eiffel Tower as it sparkles, accompanied by a delicious 3-course menu for lunch and a 4-course menu in the evening. The chef has also recently acquired a modern trattoria, Cucina, at the Maison de la Mutualité.Italy is definitely in vogue in the capital! Behind the BHV Marais department store, the ‘Eataly’ concept store, a 2,500 m² store devoted to Italian gastronomy, will open early in the year. The building will have 7 catering options, including the elegant Trattoria, on the first floor and basement, and a huge grocery store on the ground floor.5. Discover a new shopping offerParis, the shopping capital with its 17,000 shops, welcomes 29 million tourists every year. For 60% of them, shopping is the main reason for their trip! The city is therefore continually offering new retail concepts and options.
