A Dated Ticket may be delivered to the User in a dematerialized way, in the form of an e-ticket (or electronic ticket) addressed to the User by email or downloadable from the Site, and which it is the User’s responsibility to print off.‘Force Majeure’ denotes an event such as a natural catastrophe or a major political event (war, …), that turns out to be, with regard to these circumstances, unforeseeable, overwhelming and external and which is therefore considered as such by a Cour de Cassation judgement as constituting a case of force majeure.  ‘Partner’ denotes the provider(s) of Goods.‘Goods’ denotes any provision of goods, such as transport, leisure or tours, provided by a Partner that may be ordered or booked on the Site of the PCVB. The characteristics and content of the Goods are determined by the Provider of such Goods and are presented on the Site.‘Service’ denotes the ticketing service offered by the PCVB on its Site enabling the online purchase or booking of Goods. The characteristics and functionalities of these Services are described in more detail on the Site, notably in the section ‘FAQ’ which offers help in using these Services.‘User’ denotes any User of the Site who books, orders and/or buys Goods offered on the Site.Article 3. Ordering or booking on the Site www.parisinfo.com3.1 Conditions for the use of ServicesAny order or booking made and paid for via the Site implies the full and prior acceptance by the User of these GCS by ticking the box provided for this purpose and, where required, the acceptance of the contractual conditions of the Partner supplying the Goods concerned. Without this acceptance, the continuation of the order or booking process is technically impossible. The characteristics of the Goods that can be ordered or booked on the Site feature on the Site. The photos shown on the Site are however non-contractual. By ordering or booking Goods on the Site, the User implicitly acknowledges having obtained all the information they want on the nature and characteristics of these Goods.The User must be at least 18 years old and be legally able to enter into a contract and use this Site in accordance with the GCS in force on the date of validation of their order or booking.      The User attests to the veracity and accuracy of all the information that they communicate to the PCVB in the use of the Services, and thereby guarantees the PCVB against any action or claim by a third party as to an unlawful or fraudulent use of their data by a User in the use of the Services.3.2 Procedure for formalizing a contract online applicable to all Services3.2.1 These GCS are provided in French and in foreign languages (English, Spanish and German). They are available to consult at any time from any Internet page of the Site.3.2.2 The User may keep the GCS by saving or editing them, by using the standard functionalities of their web browser or their computer. This saving of them is their sole responsibility. For its part, the PCVB archives contracts made on the Site where their value is greater than 120 euros. The User can ask the PCVB for access to the archives of its contracts by sending a registered letter to the PCVB, 144 Boulevard Macdonald, 75019 Paris; this letter must be accompanied by all the elements that prove that the User is indeed the person that entered into the contract requested from the archives and a copy of their proof of identity.3.2.3 The procedure for making an online order or booking on the Site by the User involves double clicking and includes, regardless of the Service, the following steps:- Step 1: the selection by the User of the Goods required after having become acquainted with the essential characteristics of these Goods as they appear on the Site, and, for orders made via the ticketing service, the delivery mode required;- Step 2: completion of required fields on order forms or booking forms on the Site (otherwise, the order or booking request of the User will not be processed by the PCVB) and provisional validation of the information entered;- Step 3: confirmation by the User of the information on the summary shown on the Site recalling the Goods selected, the total price of the Goods and the price owed to the PCVB, and the information entered by the User, who may still at this stage identify any mistake and correct it according to the terms and conditions on the Site, or change their order or booking for convenience or simply abandon it; - Step 4: unconditional acceptance of these GCS and, where appropriate, the contractual conditions of the Partners;- Step 5: final confirmation by the User of their order or booking request on the Site after entering and validating the information relative to the means of online payment selected by the User to pay the amount owed to the PCVB under the GCS.3.2.4 The contract entered into online by the User with the PCVB becomes firm and definite and the PCVB is obliged to provide the Service, when the User (i) has proceeded to the final validation stage of the information entered and the Goods selected, (ii) has unreservedly accepted the GCS and, where applicable, the contractual conditions of the Partners and (iii) has proceeded to pay in full the price of the Goods directly to the PCVB in accordance with Article 6 below (and this payment has been received in full by the PCVB in accordance with Article 6.1.3).3.2.5 The PCVB will send an email to confirm the order in good time before the start of the Goods ordered or booked and at the latest, within seventy-two (72) hours of receipt of the order or booking by the User. This confirmation email is sent to the email address that the User entered on the order or booking form and resumes, by the sending of these GCS and specific conditions relating to the order or booking made, the contractual information required under Article L.121-19 of the Consumer Code, such as (the) Goods ordered and the identification of the supplier Partner, the price paid to the PCVB and, where applicable, the balance remaining to be paid by the User to the Partner, the delivery charges, and the address to which the User can submit any complaints.3.2.6 It is up to the User to print this confirmation email on their printer and which they must present to the Partner to benefit from the Goods ordered or booked. The User is therefore required to check beforehand that he is able to print the confirmation email. On no account can a bank statement alone serve as proof of the booking or order.3.3 Modification or cancellation of an order or booking3.3.1 The User is strongly informed of the importance of checking the accuracy of the information entered and correcting it where necessary, according to the modalities offered on the Site in the contract procedure described in Article 3.2, before any final confirmation. Any order or booking made on the Site cannot be changed online later.3.3.2 The User can however, solely in those instances and under the conditions defined in Article 4 of these GCS, or in the event of Force Majeure, change or cancel an order or booking made on the Site.3.4 Absence of the right of withdrawalIn accordance with the provisions of Article L.121-21-8 of the Consumer Code, the User is informed that he has no right of withdrawal where Goods - ‘accommodation, transport, restaurant, leisure’ - are booked or ordered at a distance, whether they be booked or ordered on the Site together in the form of a tourist package or separately, for a date or for a specific period.Article 4. Conditions specific to the ticketing Service4.1 Ordering procedureThe PCVB offers a ticketing service on the Site for tourist services such as excursions, cruises, outings, admission tickets for some museums or amusement parks, packages including admission tickets and transport tickets, reductions booklet, etc.The tickets that can be ordered on the Site are generally subject to a defined period of validity or, for some, can be bought for a specific date, as mentioned on the Site. By giving the final confirmation for their order on the Site, the User acknowledges that they are fully aware of the date or period of validity applicable to their order. Any ticket not used on the scheduled date or within the period of validity stipulated shall not be refunded.4.2 Ordering and modification of Dated TicketsWhere the User orders a Dated Ticket on the Site, the dates of the event as well as the proposed time slots are provided as an indication only to the User and are subject to availability from the Partner. Where the User books a Dated Ticket, the date and the time slot of the Dated Ticket selected by the User are only confirmed and definitive on reception by the User of the e-ticket of the Dated Ticket ordered. The order of the Dated Ticket only becomes definitive on reception of this e-ticket.As a result of this, the PCVB reserves the right to change the date and/or the time slot of the Dated Ticket booked by the User, within a period of forty-eight (48) hours of the booking of the Dated Ticket on the Site. Within this period, the PCVB will inform the User of the unavailability of the date and/or the time slot booked and will offer them the date and/or time slot closest to the one originally booked. If the new option proposed to the User is not acceptable to them, they can either choose a new date / and or time slot, or request a refund for the Dated Ticket.4.3 Delivery procedureOnce the contract has been finally concluded online in accordance with Article 3.2.4 above, the PCVB proceeds to deliver the order to the delivery address using the delivery method chosen by the User when placing their order on the Site. The various delivery methods, places, countries, and estimated deadlines offered by the PCVB are set out on the Site, as are the delivery costs. The order may also be collected by the User from the PCVB's main office at the address and according to the terms on the Site, on presentation of the order confirmation email mentioned in Article 3.2 of the GCS (or failing that, on presentation of a piece of identity in the name of the person who made the booking). With regard to Dated Tickets, the order can also be delivered in the form of an e-ticket.Where the User chooses to pick up their order from the main office of the PCVB, they have a period of two (2) months counting from the date of delivery to the PCVB, in which to retrieve their order. After this time, it will no longer be possible to pick it up and the User will not be entitled to any refund for it.In the event of distance delivery, orders made and paid for on the Site are dispatched the day after the payment made online has been validated in accordance with Article 6.1.3. Orders for which payment has been validated on a Friday or during the weekend are dispatched on the following Monday.The PCVB shall not be liable for any eventual delay or incapacity to deliver which is due to an incorrect or incomplete delivery address, or to strikes or other problems with national or international mail delivery services, disruptions or weather conditions, and will refuse to refund the order.On receiving their order, whatever the delivery method concerned, it is up to the User to ensure that the tickets delivered comply with their order. Reservations of the kind ‘subject to’, ‘subject to unpacking’, ‘package open’, etc. are not admissible in the event of a dispute. During delivery, remember to check the package in front of the carrier. Should the carrier not want to wait, please write the following on the freight order: ‘The carrier was in a hurry and did not give me time to check the parcel’.In the event of an anomaly, the User must: (i) enter very specific and descriptive written reservations on the delivery docket (e.g. number of tickets incorrect), (ii) note the exact number of missing items and give a precise description of the state of the package (open, torn, intact, etc.) and (iii) be sure to send a registered letter to the delivery organization within 48 hours. Beyond this deadline, no refund, total or partial, will be made by the PCVB. 4.4 Modification or cancellation of a booking by the UserAs the right of withdrawal is not applicable to ticketing services, the User is reminded that, excepting particular stipulations contrary to the GSC (notably Article 4.2 of the GCS) or the general conditions of sale of the Partner governing the sale of Dated Tickets, any ticket ordered on the Site is final. Consequently, tickets ordered on the Site, including Dated Tickets are neither refundable (not even in the event of loss or theft), nor exchangeable, except in case the event for which the ticket is issued is cancelled.4.5 ContactAny question or complaint relating to an order, its tracking number or any cancellation must be sent via our contact form.Article 5.

They take into account the VAT applicable on the date of the order or booking request. Prices do not include communication costs linked to the use of the Services. These remain payable by the User.6.1.2 It should be noted that the prices of Goods shown on the Site reflect the prices charged by the Partners. The PCVB is not in any way involved in determining these prices. These prices are updated on the Site when any modifications are made to the prices applied by the Partners. The prices of the Goods invoiced to the User correspond to the prices in force on the date of the final confirmation of the order or booking request made by the User on the Site.6.1.3 Payment for Goods is made online at the time of booking or ordering, by credit card, via a secure electronic payment system on the Site. It should be noted that any payment by credit card triggers an automatic debit authorization request. As the order or booking request is final after full payment of the price of the Services owed to the PCVB, any rejection, for whatever reason, implies the abandonment of the order or booking request, which will therefore not be processed by the PCVB.6.1.4 If the payment is made using PayPal, any refunds must take place within 60 days of the date of the original payment, as per PayPal’s User Agreement: https://www.paypal.com/uk/webapps/mpp/ua/useragreement-full. It is therefore the responsibility of the customer to inform PCVB that they require a refund at least 7 working days before the deadline so that PCVB can consider the claim and process the refund if necessary.6.2 Provisions specific to the ticketing ServiceThe price of the Goods ordered via the ticketing Service is paid in full to the PCVB via the Site.Subject to the provisions of Articles 4.2 and 4.4 of the GCS, it is the general sales conditions of the Partner which apply to refunds, where appropriate, of Dated Tickets. Article 7. Changes and enforceability of the GCS and GoodsThese GCS and/or the contents of the Goods may be modified at any time by the PCVB to take into account changes to the Site and/or to the Services and/or to the Goods by the Partners or, any change in the applicable regulations or any other changes implemented by the PCVB. The version of the GCS that is enforceable against the User is the one featuring on the Site at the time of the final confirmation by the User of their order or booking request.The Goods supplied to the User are those listed in the email confirming the order or booking, in accordance with the contents of the Goods as described on the Site on the date of the order or booking.Article 8. Liability of the PCVBThe PCVB may not be held liable for the total or partial breach of the contract due to a case of force majeure, to a third party to the contract or to the fault of the User. In particular, the PCVB may not be held liable for mistakes made by the User when entering information required in online forms, or in the event of the fraudulent use by a third party of the identity or means of payment of the User as identified on an order or booking request.Nor may the PCVB be held responsible for damage of any kind that may result from the Site being temporarily unavailable or the connection between the User's terminal equipment and the Site of the PCVB being interrupted while an order or booking request is being made.Article 9. Agreement as to proofThe User recognizes that the data recorded by the PCVB in the context of orders and bookings made on the Site constitute proof of all transactions entered into with the User and that the data recorded by the electronic payment system on the Site constitute proof of financial transactions.Article 10. Personal dataThe PCVB collects personal data concerning the User in the context of Services provided on the Site, for itself/ and/or for its Partners or Service providers, so as to be able to process and carry out their order or booking request on the Site.

In accordance with the Data Protection Act of the 6 January 1978 as amended, the User has the right to access, modify and delete data concerning them as well as the right to object, for legal reasons, to the processing of their data. The User can exercise these rights by sending a registered letter with return delivery receipt accompanied by a copy of a valid piece of identity to the following address: OTCP, Parisinfo.com - Service Client, Direction E-business & marketing internet, 144 Boulevard Macdonald, 75019 Paris, France.It should be noted that the data collection forms on the Site specify compulsory and optional fields. It should be noted that if the User fails to fill in a compulsory field, the PCVB will be unable to process their request. The purpose of other requests for information calling for an optional response or relative to the interest of the User, for offers likely to be sent to them, is to get to know the User better as well as improve the services offered to them.
