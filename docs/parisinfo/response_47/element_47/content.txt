It gathers together all of the global food sector to share solutions for today and for the future, and discover opportunities for growth and new trends in the agri-food industry.Recent openings:The end of 2017 and early 2018 were marked by some promising openings in the capital.Inveterate foodies will want to sample Spoon, a veritable travel book of flavours by starred chef Alain Ducasse in the Palais Brongniart — available for private hire for 50 to 110 people; or Rural by Marc Veyrat (300 covers), with country-inn charm, at the heart of the Palais des Congrès de Paris and serving local food and dishes. Plus, don’t miss La Verrière (80 covers) in the arty Montparnasse district: this restaurant at the new hotel Niepce Paris serves fine food in warm and welcoming interiors. Finally, Alain Ducasse puts his signature on Bistrot Benoit. This new address in the Louvre Museum takes iconic recipes from traditional French cuisine and adds a contemporary twist to them, like at the restaurant’s big brother Benoit. For a shopping trip followed by lunch with 360° views over Paris, go to the Printemps du Goût, which mixes market and deli produce with eating spaces based around 100% French products.For gourmets in search of unusual experiences, O’Naturel, the first naturist restaurant in Paris, serves bistronomic dishes made from fresh and seasonal products, whilst aboard the Bus Burger (31 seats), a mobile restaurant, you can enjoy sightseeing comfortably seated, in American diner style.More intimate places like Bubble Suite — a champagne bar with art deco interiors at the Hilton Paris Opéra — are also cropping up, (available for private hire for up to 45 people); or Secret 8 (25 people), a bar hidden away in the Buddha Bar, serving original cocktails in a private atmosphere.Upcoming openings:The Brasserie du Lutetia, in the famous eponymous hotel that has had a massive makeover, will open sometime in September, with a menu designed by triple-starred chef Gérald Passedat. For sunny days, La Baleine restaurant (90 covers) and its magnificent terrace, in the Jardin des Plantes, will reopen after several months of renovation work.Maison Plisson, which has become somewhat of a Parisian institution in just a few short years, will take the wraps off its second boutique in May. Located in a 1,200 m² space in Marché Saint-Honoré, it will be a market, a delicatessen, a wine cellar, and a restaurant all rolled into one. And for fans of Italian gastronomy, Eataly, a dedicated 4,000 m² megastore will be inaugurated in the Marais in early 2019.The 2018 Michelin Guide starred restaurants:As well as a rich programme of events and new openings mentioned above, in 2018 Paris accounts for 106 starred restaurants following the publication of the famous guide in February of this year: 9 restaurants more than in 2017 and 18 new ones. The ideal opportunity to present some of them below!1*Benoit is certainly attracting a lot of attention! Opened in 1912, this typical restaurant serving authentic cooking is the only starred Parisian bistro. Located just a few steps from City Hall, it puts the accent on French tradition in a friendly atmosphere. The Jules Verne (closed for renovations), another Alain Ducasse 1* restaurant, is perched at a height of 125 metres in the Eiffel Tower and revisits the classics of French gastronomy. Over towards the Champs Elysées, the restaurant Laurent, a former hunting lodge of Louis XIV, is of note for its creative cuisine and excellent wine cellar. Nearby, Lasserre offers refined cuisine in a prestigious setting. And Copenhague, on the first floor of the Maison du Danemark towards the top of the Avenue, rethinks Nordic cuisine in an elegant dining space. The restaurant has just been awarded its first star thanks to its young chef, Andreas Møller, who has only been in residence for a year.2*Palace restaurants take centre stage. The Sur-Mesure at the Mandarin Oriental, headed by Thierry Marx, promises a haute couture meal in a minimalist setting. The chef plays on the five senses in the gourmet menus combining technique and pure emotion. For authentic decor, book a table at the Meurice Alain Ducasse restaurant, inspired by the Salon de la Paix at the Palace of Versailles, and enjoy the flavours of exceptional dishes. The Shangri-La Hotel also offers glamorous dining at its restaurant L’Abeille, whose name pays homage tothe Napoleonic emblem. Chef Christophe Moret has created a menu that focuses on exceptional products, served in a delightful hushed atmosphere.3*For 3* restaurants, the bucolic Pré Catelan, in the Bois de Boulogne, stands out for its modern decoration that enhances the historic elegance of the place. Chef Frédéric Anton, a figure of contemporary French cuisine and Meilleur Ouvrier de France in 2000, creates original compositions that are a feast for the palate and the eyes. Finally, Alain Ducasse au Plaza Athénée offers a sublime dining experience, visually and in terms of flavours. The dining space is bounded by three huge polished stainless bell covers, evoking a world of architecture and design. The cooking, full of contrasts and harmony, seeks to be natural and respectful of the planet.See the full list of stars for 2018 here.
