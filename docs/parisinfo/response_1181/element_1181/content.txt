The artist produced many paintings, advertisements and methodical (almost scientific) architectural projects, where he played with selected lines, squares, ovals and colours. This great retrospective covers all aspects and facets of the artist’s work, which are presented chronologically.The iconic Centre Pompidou, with its unique architecture, has many private spaces for hire that enable it to host up to 2,000 people.

Both artists were modernist masters of the 20th century. Focussing on figurative themes and abstract themes, this exhibition looks at their exploration of the void, examining their similarities and their differences whilst at the same time looking at the relation between them.The Musée Picasso has a reception area spread over 200 m² and an adjoining 70 m²-space that can accommodate up to 300 people for a cocktail party and 110 people for dinner. A privileged visit of the permanent collections and of the temporary exhibition is offered in complement to a private event.Request a proposalFranz Marc and August Macke (1909-1914) – Musée de l’Orangerie From 6 March to 17 June 2019The two painters and friends Franz Marc and August Macke began their careers with a fascination for landscape and nature. Both expressed a strong interest in French art, in particular the paintings of Van Gogh and Gauguin and Fauvism that they discovered in Paris. After encountering Vassily Kandinsky in 1911, their works took on a more radical, stylized turn and they founded the Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider Almanach). Through some sixty works, this exhibition presents these two iconic artists of the colourful and attractive German Expressionism movement, artists who have so far been little shown in France.The Musée de l’Orangerie, in the Tuileries Gardens, welcomes your professional events for up to 350 people on its two floors.
