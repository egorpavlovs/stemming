            Day 1
            
            
                        
                            
                            1 Sentosa Island
                            Morning: Fun under the sun
Escape the urban jungle and make your way to Sentosa, Singapore’s exhilarating island resort.
There’s much to do here—you could take the young ones to Adventure Cove WaterPark™ for thrilling slides and encounters with marine life, or, if they’re a little older, to visit the Skyline Luge (part go-cart, part-toboggan action ride) or iFly Singapore to try indoor skydiving along the coast of Sentosa.

                        
                    
                        
                            
                            2 Gardens by the Bay
                            Afternoon: Get in touch with nature 
After spending a morning at the beach, opt for a change of scenery and take a stroll around Gardens by the Bay. This magnificent nature park is unlike anything you’ve ever seen before, featuring futuristic-looking Supertrees that tower over the gardens. Walk through cooled conservatories and glass greenhouses that are home to a stunning myriad of flora, some of which are extremely rare.
Then, pop by Supertree Dining for a midday meal. This multi-concept dining spot houses several eateries, including the halal-certified Texas Chicken, Hill Street Coffee Shop (try toast with kaya, a traditional jam made from coconut and eggs), and Oriental Western and Bistro, a modern family-friendly restaurant that offers fusion food.

                        
                    
                        
                            
                            3 Marina Bay
                            Evening: Wander around the bay area
Ready for dinner? The gorgeous Marina Bay Sands® is chock-full of celebrity chef restaurants if your family is interested in sampling some fine plates. Otherwise, go for a delicious spread of delights at RISE, a buffet restaurant featuring international creations that everyone will enjoy.
Then pop by the nearby Merlion Park across Marina Bay Sands® to snap shots of the Singapore icon—a 8.6-metre-tall half-fish, half-lion statue—and take in lovely views of the city.

                            4 Singapore Flyer
                            Morning: Take the wheel
Treat yourself and the family to a visual feast first thing in the morning by going aboard the Singapore Flyer. The giant ferris wheel takes you 165 metres above ground and offers amazing 360-degree city views. On a clear day, you can even see certain parts of Malaysia and Indonesia!

                        
                    
                        
                            
                            5 PS.Cafe
                            Afternoon: Tuck into some midday treats
After visiting the Singapore Flyer, spend the afternoon indulging in tasty Modern European creations (with a touch of Asian influence) at PS.Cafe. The Dempsey outlet has an outdoor lawn and a garden for the kids to run around in, while the adults can enjoy dishes like a satisfying steak sandwich and a Tiger Beer-battered fish and chips.
Don’t forget dessert. The whole family’s bound to love signature sweets like PS.Cafe’s luscious sticky date pudding—a must-try when you’re there.

                        
                    
                        
                            
                            6 Orchard Road
                            Evening: Shopping in town
Come post-lunch, the clan can wander around the world-famous Orchard Road. At malls like Paragon and Forum, adults can shop at stores like Banana Republic and Calvin Klein Platinum, while kids have endless hours of fun at the available play areas.
With its smorgasbord of dining options, there’s really no need to go anywhere else for dinner so stick around Orchard Road. Swensen's (ION Orchard), OverEasy (Liat Towers), Tony Roma's (Orchard Central) and Chinese restaurant Din Tai Fung (Paragon) are all great family restaurants that serve up creations everyone will love, from fried chicken and mouth-watering burgers to juicy ribs and delicious soup dumplings.
After dinner, take a little walk down Orchard Road and grab dessert by stopping by the ice cream carts for a sweet, cold ice cream sandwich.

                            Morning and afternoon: let’s go to the zoo
Head to the Singapore Zoo, an award-winning 26-hectare wildlife park that’s home to more than 2,800 animals. Explore the various zones like Wild Africa, Primate Kingdom, Reptile Garden and heaps more.
Don't forget to bring the little ones to the Rainforest Kidzworld for pony rides and lots of aquatic fun at the wet play area, and of course, stick around for the signature Animal Friends show.

                            Evening: stay out late in the wild
For your final stop, hop on over to the Night Safari. Located right next door to the Singapore Zoo, this park welcomes guests to experience the world’s first nocturnal safari experience, and is best seen on wheels. Get on the tram and enjoy the 40-minute ride across the park’s seven geographical zones, such as the Himalayan Foothills and the Indian Subcontinent, and spot residents like endangered Asian elephant and big cats such as the Malayan tiger.
We’ve done the hard part—planning out your three days in Singapore—so now, all you have to do is follow the plan and have a blast with the family in Singapore.
