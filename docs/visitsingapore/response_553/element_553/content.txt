	    Taking AIME to win the best innovative stand
	




	
	
	
	Held from 23 to 24 February 2016 at the Melbourne Convention and Exhibitions Centre, the Asia Pacific Incentives and Meetings Expo (AIME) is the largest international event of its kind in Australia. This annual trade show brings together a community of corporates, meetings, events and incentives industry decision makers to network and meet new business leads.
 
This year, STB led a delegation of 17 stakeholders including hotels, venues and Destination Marketing Companies (DMCs) to the show. Over the 2-day tradeshow, numerous meetings took place with more discussions being held on the sidelines.
 
Highlights of the tradeshow included:

Pre-event lunch at The Deck in Southgate for participating stakeholders. Guest speaker, Gary Bender, owner and Managing Director of World Corporate Travel, an award-winning Australian corporate travel and event management company, gave an insightful presentation on the business events’ needs of Australians and gave tips on what Singapore offers and lacks – indeed, food for thought for the lunch session!
Networking Happy Hour hosted at the booth on Day 1 where AIME attendees were invited to get a taste of authentic Singaporean delicacies from Bengawan Solo and Killiney Kopitiam.
Your Virtual Singapore Experience showcase presenting a 360 degree virtual reality experience of Singapore’s sights and sounds.


	
	
	

	
	Winning the Best Innovative Stand 
	
	The Virtual Singapore Experience Room at AIME not only created buzz and drew much admiration on the tradeshow floor, but was also the clincher for Singapore winning Best Innovative Stand at AIME 2016.
The pop-up installation leveraged video projection mapping to transform a plain wall surface into a panoramic display screen, and gave participants the opportunity to experience a 360-degree fly-through of Singapore. 
Using a touch-screen function projected on the wall, participants were able to choose between browsing through an interactive viewing gallery showcasing different facets of Singapore and experiencing a 3-D flythrough of Singapore’s unique attractions and meeting spaces.
These categories presented Singapore’s unique meeting spaces, gastronomic experiences, entertainment and nightlife, culture and heritage, as well as our recently-awarded UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Singapore Botanic Gardens.
Your Virtual Singapore Experience Room received many positive reviews and was a success in attracting curious visitors to the Singapore booth. This presented an opportunity to showcase Singapore as a leading MICE destination while giving stakeholders a chance to meet new leads, create more awareness for their brands and gain more insight into the Australian market.

	Technologies showcased at tradeshows
	
	Various Virtual Reality (VR) initiatives have been launched at major MICE tradeshows in recent years to engage and deliver the Singapore experience to meeting planners.
In addition to highlighting Singapore’s attractiveness as a meetings destination and facilitating business development, this has also sparked conversations about Singapore’s value proposition in the areas of technological innovation and creativity.
