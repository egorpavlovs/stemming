The Michelin Bib Gourmand awards for 2018 is out, and the results are a real doozy, with 50 restaurants making the cut. With 17 new entries, this year’s Bib Gourmand award cements Singapore’s status as a foodie paradise.
Established in 1997, the Michelin Bib Gourmand award recognises restaurants that offer stellar food at an affordable price (capped at a maximum of $45). This year’s winners include some of Singapore’s most beloved hawkers and an eclectic mix of noteworthy restaurants.
Whether you’re hankering for new tastes or revisiting our sunny island and hoping to experience familiar flavours, you should check out our comprehensive guide to this year’s winners (newly-awarded establishments are denoted with an [N] for your convenience).

                    A Noodle Story
Founded by Gwern Khoo and Ben Tham—a pair of friends from culinary school—A Noodle Story combines modern European techniques with Asian flavours to create this uniquely Singaporean flavoured ramen. Leveraging on their training at Shatec and stints in the kitchens of Waku Ghin, Iggy’s and St Pierre, the duo founded their business in 2013, and first won Michelin Bib Gourmand plaudits in 2016.
This hawker stall’s signature dish is composed of springy egg noodles, roast pork, dumplings and potato-wrapped prawns, and topped off with a hard-boiled egg.

                Famous Sungei Road Trishaw Laksa
The wisdom of the masses can be a great way to hone one’s craft. This is evidenced by Daniel Soo—the stall owner of Famous Sungei Road Trishaw Laksa—who literally crowdsourced the recipe of his famous dish by listening intently to customer feedback and suggestions. Besides laksa (spicy coconut-based noodle soup), visitors should also try the store’s signature mee siam (rice vermicelli in a sweet and sour gravy), which incorporates fruit juice to enhance the flavour.

                Hong Kee Beef Noodle
Originally located at Kock Street, this hawker has been in operation for over five decades. With beef stock that’s cooked over 24 hours for maximum flavour, this hawker serves up comforting bowls of beef noodles from its stall in Amoy Street Food Centre. Be sure to get all the trimmings—including tripe and beef meatballs—for a full-on meat medley in your mouth.

                Hoo Kee Bak Chang
For over five decades, Hoo Kee has been serving up only one food item: bak chang (rice dumpling). Third-generation owner Ryk Chew juggled the business with a day job in a telecommunications company, before diving into F&B full-time in 2010. The establishment’s pyramid-shaped Hokkien dumpling is made from moist glutinous rice, filled with marinated pork and roasted chestnuts, and wrapped in fragrant bamboo leaves.

                    J2 Famous Crispy Curry Puff
Singapore’s answer to the Spanish empanada, this savoury pastry is traditionally filled with curry chicken and potatoes. The husband and wife team whipping up these iconic treats stayed the course despite the closure of their original bakery, and opened J2 Famous Crispy Curry Puff in 2007. The stall offers a variety of flavours, including black pepper chicken and sardine. Pop ‘em while they’re hot, folks!

                    Kok Sen Restaurant
Characterised by its old-school décor of white tiles and large wooden communal tables, this no-frills eatery in the Keong Saik enclave is famous for its wok-fried hor fun (flat rice flour noodles). Kok Sen Restaurant’s other top dishes are written on strips of paper in Mandarin and pasted on the wall, but if you’re not conversant in Chinese, we recommend that you also order the claypot yong tau foo (Hakka Chinese cuisine consisting primarily of tofu filled with ground meat mixture or fish paste).
Kok Sen Restaurant. 30 Keong Saik Road, Singapore 089137. +65 6223 2005.

                Lian He Ben Ji Claypot Rice [N]
Lian He Ben Ji Claypot Rice first opened its doors in 1979, and its current owner, Madam Lim, is the daughter-in-law of the stall’s original founder. Having worked in hawker stalls since the age of 12, Madam Lim is no stranger to the nuances of creating this traditional staple: The claypot rice served here is cooked on charcoal stoves from scratch, with juicy meat that’s marinated to perfection.

While the tender steamed chicken featured in the dish is certainly delectable, this establishment’s chicken rice is most famous for its fragrant rice and complex, spicy chilli sauce.

Once eaten by coolies, bak kut teh (peppery pork soup) was brought to Singapore from Fujian by Chinese migrant labourers in the 19th century and has since evolved into a much-beloved comfort food. Second-generation owners Diana Yeo and Hart Pong may have modernised the stall (you can order your meal on an iPad), but Song Fa Bak Kut Teh’s rendition of this peppery, garlicky delight stays true to the family’s original recipe.

The owner of the stall purports to have learnt his craft from an unnamed master, and has been making the dishes for over a decade. "Back then it was tough, and everything was done by hand” he reminisces. “Not like today, when there are machines to assist us.”

The pots are lovingly cooked over charcoal for 45 minutes, a sure sign that good things come to those who wait!

New Ubin Seafood has its origins on the island sanctuary of Pulau Ubin, off Singapore’s eastern coast. Once a humble home serving up kampong (traditional village)-style seafood, the establishment has since moved to the mainland and made a reputation for itself with its plates of zi char (dishes influenced by home-cooked Chinese food, meant for sharing). Be sure to try the satay (grilled skewered meat) and the garlic baked crab.

Chai Chuan Tou Yang Rou has been serving up rich, Teochew-style mutton soup from Bukit Merah View Hawker Centre for over three decades. The fact that this stall only opens for lunch is testament to how quickly its signature dish sells out.

With signature Hokkien mee (fried prawn noodles) cooked to order in small batches and fried up in a wok to retain its traditional, slightly charred flavour, it’s no wonder that Hong Heng Fried Sotong Prawn Mee has been around as long as Tiong Bahru Market itself.
