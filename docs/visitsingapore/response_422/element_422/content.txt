                            1 Orchard Road
                            Orchard Road isn’t just well known amongst locals—travellers far and wide are familiar with one of the world’s most famous shopping districts. You’ll find fascinating modern structures like ION Orchard, which houses some of your favourite luxury brands, such as Louis Vuitton, Patek Philippe, Saint Laurent, and Tiffany & Co.
There’s also Singapore’s oldest departmental store, TANGS, which stocks plenty of local labels like Aijek (a clothing line featuring effortless pieces from sustainable fabrics) and a range of international perfume labels like See by Chloé here.

                        
                    
                        
                            
                            2 Civic District
                            More homegrown names await you at Capitol Piazza in City Hall. One of Singapore’s newest luxury shopping malls, Capitol Piazza is home to local labels like Benjamin Barker (shop for classic menswear pieces here) and SABRINAGOH, a multi-label concept store offering the designer's contemporary creations along with other like-minded local and regional labels.
Also, great news for lovers of bold, vibrant prints: Finnish brand Marimekko has a standalone store right here in Capitol Piazza. It's easy to get carried away browsing through the choices of chic apparel and home décor. If you want to get your hands on more luxury goods, there's The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands®.

                            3 Bras Basah.Bugis
                            Go on the hunt for artsy collectibles and indie labels around the Bugis and Bras Basah area, Singapore’s buzzing cultural district.
Bras Basah Complex is great for art supplies (go to the long-standing Art Friend for this), hard-to-find design literature (Basheer Graphic Books), and second-hand books (Evernew Book Store and Book Point).
After satisfying your inner culture vulture, head on over to Haji Lane for more indie outlets. This Instagram-worthy lane is lined with stores like Mondays Off for home décor and lifestyle products and Kolombiana for bright, handmade bags and accessories that are perfect for travel.

                            Make your way to Tiong Bahru—one of Singapore’s most hip ’hoods—for its eclectic mix of stores. Spend the afternoon visiting indie bookstores BooksActually (don't forget to say hello to the resident kitties) and Woods in the Books, and Curated Records for some vinyl-lovin'.
                        
                    
                        
                            
                            5 Little India
                            Does poking around a shopping mall that's open 24 hours, seven days a week sound like a dream to you? Well then, park yourself in Mustafa Centre. Located in Little India, this massive complex has everything you need, and we mean everything, from DVDs to spices, gold jewellery and TVs.
If you’re on the hunt for cultural trinkets and more, wander around the streets of Little India and you’ll find several shops that stock all sorts of pretty things, from sari (a traditional Indian costume consisting of a long cloth wrapped around the body) to bangles.

                            6 Queenstown
                            Drop by places like Queensway Shopping Centre and the nearby Anchorpoint Shopping Centre if you wish to be kind to your wallet and score fab deals instead. The former has an impressive number of sports stores for you to buy sneakers, apparel, and even equipment on the cheap (manage your expectations, though—many of these items are from past seasons and collections), while the latter is where you'll find irresistible discounts and promotions from factory outlets of brands like Charles & Keith, Billabong and Hush Puppies.
 
                        
                    
                        
                            
                            7 Singapore Changi Airport
                            Don’t let this one slip, especially if you’re in town for a while. Be sure to enjoy duty-free shopping for yourself (or do some last-minute souvenir shopping) at Changi Airport; the range of options is diverse—from Adidas to Burberry and COACH—and entirely dependent on which terminal you’re in.
With all these places to hit up and goods to purchase, you’ll be spoilt for choice.
