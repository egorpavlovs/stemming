		Bay South Garden is the largest of the gardens. Inspired by an orchid, the design resembles Singapore's national flower, Papilionanthe Miss Joaquim. You can’t miss the massive Supertrees—Tree-shaped vertical gardens that are between nine to 16 storeys tall.
Stroll on the suspended walkway between two Supertrees to enjoy a bird’s eye view of the gardens. In the evening, catch the sky show of choreographed lights and sounds at the Garden Rhapsody amidst the Supertrees.
Head to Bay East Garden for the perfect picnic setting with lush lawns and tropical palm trees. From the waterfront promenade, you will see a picturesque view of the city skyline.
	


        A forest in the clouds

		
        

		
        

		
        

		
		Unique to Gardens by the Bay is the Cloud Forest. Within the enclosed compound, a 35-metre tall mountain is veiled in mist and covered in lush vegetation amidst the world’s tallest indoor waterfall. Here, you will find plant life from tropical highlands up to 2,000 metres above sea level.
The natural beauty of the gardens translates indoors. Dine in style at a range of eateries across the gardens, from casual cafes to posh restaurants, all with interiors designed to reflect the splendour of Gardens by the Bay.

                            The Flower Dome replicates the cool-dry climate of Mediterranean regions and houses a collection of plants from deserts all over the world.

                            These beautiful lakes are a rich source of aquatic life and also act as an eco-filter to cleanse water pumped in from the Marina Reservoir.
