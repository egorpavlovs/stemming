	                  “We can learn so much from the best practices highlighted in [BEX Asia]. Education is key in pushing for sustainability and a green community, which is why we’ve always turn to expositions like these to be able to learn and cascade what could work for [the Philippines].” — Miguel Guerrero, architect and co-founder of Green Architecture Advocacy Philippines
	              
	          
	
	Highlights 
	Together with the IGBC, BEX Asia 2014 introduced the new “Go Green, Dress Lean” dress code, which encouraged visitors to come with “no coat, no tie” when touring the exhibition halls. BEX Asia 2014 was also the first edition that had energy-saving LED tube lights installed for all the eco-booths, thanks to official lighting sponsor Enovatek Energy, which was an exhibitor at BEX Asia. Last year’s event marked the return of the highly popular Green View seminar series. More than double the expected number of participants came for the sharing sessions, in which visitors engaged industry experts in discussions on green building topics ranging from façade optimisation to intelligent buildings.

	
	
	

	
	              
	                  BEX Asia is an ideal platform for sourcing and networking across the Asia-Pacific region. It has the right attributes towards the green movement and a strong focus on the latest in building energy-efficient technologies that is available in the market - Eugene Quek, Director
AGC Asia Pacific
	              
	          
	
	The results
	Over the three-day event, more than US$110 million in business transactions was generated, and over 200 business meetings were set up to facilitate partnerships between exhibitors and visitors. At the same time, the total carbon footprint for BEX Asia and IGBC was kept relatively low at 41 tonnes of carbons emission, with 13 per cent of the general waste recycled. The new “Go Green, Dress Lean” initiative was well received, as 90 per cent of participants for both IGBC and BEX Asia 2014 gamely followed the dress code, which helped greatly in keeping electricity usage low and comfort levels high.
