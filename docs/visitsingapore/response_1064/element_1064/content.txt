                                        While most noodle dishes tend to consist of just one type of noodle, Hokkien Prawn Mee is made with vermicelli and yellow wheat noodles.

		Also known as Hokkien mee (fried prawn noodles), this stir-fried noodle dish is steeped in aromatic stock made of pork bones and prawn heads.
This lip-smacking noodle dish—comprising yellow noodles and thick 'bee hoon' (vermicelli)—has juicy prawns, squid, pork belly strips, egg and crunchy fried pork lard (optional) that makes everything taste extra good. It is served with sambal chilli and a squeeze of lime juice for that added zing.
As its name suggests, Hokkien Prawn Mee is a dish created by Hokkiens. But its origins are a little uncertain.
	


        Tracing its Hokkien history

		
        

		
        

		
        

		
		Some say it was originally known as Rochor Mee because it was first sold at Rochor Road. Hokkien sailors who had worked at noodle factories in post-war Singapore would gather at Rochor Road in the evenings to fry the excess noodles from the factories over charcoal stoves. Others suggest that a stall beside the 7th Storey Hotel near Rochor Road first created this dish.
Yet some point out that Rochor Mee was the Peranakan interpretation of the dish, which is cooked with more gravy and accompanied by sambal—a more common version these days. The original Hokkien mee is supposedly fried till dry and eaten with sliced red chilli.
But it does not matter which account is true, just know that the noodles, typically found in hawker centres, are delightfully delicious.

                Talk about mixed origins! Besides being a Hokkien dish, most hawkers selling this dish at food centres in the 1980s were Teochew.
