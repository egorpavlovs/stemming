	    Build Eco Xpo Asia 2014
	




	
	
	Overview
	Build Eco Xpo (BEX) Asia is an annual green building and construction industry exhibition that features sustainable building solutions, designs and technologies. Themed “Building Today, Sustaining Tomorrow”, BEX Asia 2014 was held from 1 to 3 September 2014, in conjunction with the International Green Building Conference (IGBC). IGBC was organised by the Building and Construction Authority of Singapore (BCA), during the Singapore Green Building Week. With BEX Asia 2014, the organiser Reed Exhibitions renewed its green commitment, seeking ways to reduce the carbon footprint of the event, while getting visitors and exhibitors alike to join in the green movement.
The seventh edition of BEX Asia took place at Marina Bay Sands Expo and Convention Centre, Singapore. It brought together 410 exhibiting companies from 35 countries, including Australia, China, France, Japan, Malaysia, Taiwan, the US and the UK. It attracted 9,755 trade visitors from 43 countries, eager to check out the latest innovations displayed.

	
	
	

	
	
	Execution
	Prior to the event, Reed Exhibitions sent exhibitors eco tips such as using e-marketing to reduce material waste, and eco-friendly materials for booth decorations. On its end, it relied on technology to cut down on material waste such as creating an e-directory to list exhibitors and products, online event registration forms for trade visitors, and using iPads to collect survey information. Reed Exhibitions also relied on mobile advertisements (full-body car decals) instead of advertising banners for pre-event marketing.

	
	
	

	
	
	
	At BEX Asia 2014, energy efficient measures were adopted for the event venue. Without compromising visibility, the lighting in the conference halls and rooms was set at lower intensities during the set-up and actual event. The air-conditioning temperature for these areas was also set at an optimal 25 degrees Celsius. Waste was reduced significantly in many ways, as with previous editions of BEX Asia. No aisle carpets, which are usually non-biodegradable and not reusable, were used in the halls. To reduce plastic use, water dispensers were provided in lieu of bottled water; plastic holders were not used for the delegate and attendee badges; and reusable utensils and plates were provided in lounges and dining areas.

	
	
	

	
	
	
	Reed Exhibitions also reached out to green-minded partners and vendors, such as venue host Marina Bay Sands and contractor Kingsmen Creatives, to help reduce the ecological footprint of BEX Asia 2014. For instance, Marina Bay Sands ensured that clean, unconsumed food from meals provided at the event was donated to charity organisations.
