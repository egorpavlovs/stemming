		If you have time to visit only one place to learn about the history and culture of Singapore, this is probably it. The National Museum of Singapore tells you the intriguing story of this country in a manner that is both fun and rewarding.
Imagine standing in the midst of a vast darkened space surrounded by a massive video montage showing everyday life in Singapore while a rousing symphony plays in the background. That’s just a taste of the immersive experience you can expect here.
	


        

		
        

		
        
			
                
                
                  
			
		

		
        

		
		With its history dating back to 1887, the National Museum of Singapore is the nation’s oldest, and one of the city’s architectural icons. Its permanent offerings, the Singapore Gallery and Life in Singapore: The Past 100 Years galleries, piece together the past and present in a compelling narrative.

The building itself is a wondrous structure that has seamlessly fused the old with the new, enhancing the elegant neo-classical building with a new modernist extension of glass and metal.
The museum hosts a dynamic range of events through the year—from art installations and festivals to performances and film screenings—in addition to presenting exhibitions involving historically and culturally important collections of artefacts. One of the latest immersive art installations – Story of the Forest by teamLab allows visitors to experience the treasured collections of the Museum being brought to life through a spectacular digital presentation.
A selection of cafes and restaurants, as well as a retail space to pick up some souvenirs, round off a spectacular cultural offering.
