                    Fried Carrot Cake
                    
                    
                    

                    
                        
                    

                            
                       
                            Contrary to its name, there's nary a tinge of orange in the local fried carrot cake, a flavourful dish that comes in the monochrome colours of black or white.

                                        Don’t make the mistake of having this ‘cake’ for dessert—Singapore’s fried carrot cake is usually eaten as a hearty meal, or as a sharing dish at hawker centres.
                                    
                                    
                                
                    
                    
                        
                            
                                
                                    
                                    
                                        Fried carrot cake, made from soft fried rice cakes with black soya sauce
                                        
                                    
                                
                                
                                
                                
                                    
                                        There are two distinct variations of fried carrot cake—a white version that’s fried on top of a beaten egg, and a black version that gets its colour from being cooked with sweet soy sauce.

		Do not confuse this with the dessert carrot cake, a moist cake made with carrot and spices; covered with cream cheese frosting.
This savoury carrot cake has no carrot, at least not of the orange variety. Instead, the core ingredients of the cake are rice flour and white radish, which some call white carrot. The mixture is steamed, then cut into cubes and fried with garlic, eggs and preserved radish called 'chai poh'.
Commonly referred to as 'chai tow kway' in the Teochew dialect, these smooth and soft fried rice cakes can be found in almost every hawker centre. It is served black (fried with sweet dark soya sauce) or white (original).
	


        Chinese rice cake

		
        

		
        

		
        

		
		The simple dish has its origins in Southern China’s Chaoshan province. There, it is known as 'chao gao guo' (fried starch cake) which is made mainly with rice flour. Fish sauce and black sweetened soya sauce are used to marinate the rice cake before it is cut and fried with eggs, oysters and prawns.
Brought over to Singapore by Teochew immigrants, it was known as 'char kway' (fried rice cake), which was simply cubes of rice cakes fried with dark soya sauce.
Teochew hawker Ng Soik Theng claims to be the first to have called this dish 'chai tow kway' in the 1960s when she added white radish to it. Another hawker, Lau Goh, is said to have popularised the white version.

                Did you know?
                The misnomer of this dish’s name gave rise to a popular guidebook to local street food called ‘There’s no Carrot in Carrot Cake’.
