        The World Rugby Sevens returns to Singapore for a fourth outing.

		
        

		
        
			
                
                Thumbs up for the sporting fans who turn up in all manner of flashy costumes and tribe colours every year to support their favourite rugby teams and players.
                  
			
		

		
        

		
		Two days of 45 intense match-ups will put the endurance of 16 tenacious rugby teams to the ultimate test, all for the chance to be crowned champion. Diehard fans and supporters turn up in droves to cheer on their gladiators on the arduous road to glory.
Off the pitch, it’s more thrills galore in the city to keep fans happily occupied. Mingle with rugby legends at the fringe festivals or attend clinics by national team coaches during the day, and check out the parties at night at party venues like Clarke Quay that offer a variety of music genres and cuisines. Come in your flashiest costumes to support your favourite team – after all, Sevens fans are known for their love of the wild and wacky. Coming with little ones? They’ll be happily occupied in the kids fun zone in the Festival Village, which feature roving performers, face painters, fairground games, photo booths, stage performances and merchandise stores.
Singapore hosts the eighth of the World Rugby Sevens’ 10 legs and is the only Southeast Asian host nation. Get your passes at an early bird discounted rate, or better yet, purchase a family package and get all your loved ones in the action!

                Did you know?
                Seven-a-side rugby is played at a much faster pace than the conventional 15-a-side game. As fewer players are fielded to cover the 100-metre pitch, they each have to run further. Each team is only allowed five interchanges and five substitutions per game. Don’t blink! Halves are only seven minutes long and conversions have to be taken via drop-kick within 30 seconds.
