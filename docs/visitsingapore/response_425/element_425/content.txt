Mark

            SNEAKER ARTIST, STREETWEAR DESIGNER
            With a dedicated following of sneaker collectors both locally and abroad, Mark channels punk’s unbridled spirit in his shoe customisations and streetwear designs. Inspired by his painter father and the rebellious nature of punk rock, a young Mark spent countless evenings sketching cartoons of the 1990s in his science textbooks.
He spent the days of his youth skateboarding at the Padang, an activity that still influences his iconic designs. In 2002, he sold his first pair of customised Nikes online, a sale that kick-started his journey as a pioneer in the field of sneaker design. Since then, Mark’s home-grown label—SBTG—has attracted the attention of international celebrities like Kobe Bryant.


            
        
    








    
        
            
                Freedom
as inspiration
 

            
            
                Mark’s passion for design stems from the tough lessons he learnt while picking up skateboarding. “Skateboarding is a brutal teacher,” he shares. “To land a trick, you first learn how to fall.” This determination to forge his own life path inspired him to buck societal expectations, and turn his passion for design into a career. The tenets of freedom that underlies punk and skateboarding still inspire him to this day: “Growing up in the 1980s, everybody wanted to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I’ve always had an anti-establishment attitude. Skateboarding taught me how to think independently.”

                            Transforming sneakers into unique works of art is Mark Ong's passion. The artist, better known as "SBTG", hand-paints each shoe in bright, graffiti-inspired colours.

Mark's dad also has an eye for design and craftsmanship—the pair often collaborate to brainstorm for fresh ideas.

                            Mark considers his friends sources of inspiration, too. An evening spent at a watering hole with them may lead him to the big 'Eureka!' moment, and then it's off to the studio again.

                            Like many of the street artists he idolises, Mark is hugely into skating. While he can't land as many tricks as he could when he was younger, he continues to explore the city on his deck.
                        
                        
                    
                
                
            
        
        
    








    
        
            
                Mark's 
urban playgrounds

            
            
                From fusion cuisine that mirrors his iconic design style, to skateboarding routes that influenced his mindset as a young designer, Mark invites you to explore the city that inspires him.

                
            
        
    







    
        
            
            
            
            
            
            
        
        
            
            Alert to urban forms
            “Skateboarding forces you to be more alert to the world around you,” Mark shares. Under the Helix Bridge at Marina Bay Sands®—where he makes a point to skate every Saturday—he mindfully navigates the urban terrain. It is this dynamic perspective that defines him and his works.

            
                
            
            
        
    










    
        
            
            
            
            
            
            
        
        
            
            Fuelled by fusion
            When he needs to fuel up for new escapades, Mark heads to Lokkee. Like his designs, the establishment’s menu blends Eastern and Western influences. “Lokkee presents itself differently: It’s not just that the ingredients are fresher. It’s definitely more innovative than standard Chinese food.”

            
                
            
            
        
    










    
        
            
            
            
            
            
            
        
        
            
            A pioneer of new designs 
            Over the years, SBTG has expanded to include apparel, leather products and industry collaborations. To see the fruits of Mark’s pioneering labour, visit Limited Edt Store at Marina Bay Sands®. “I feel a responsibility to show the next generation that you can be an independent artist,” he shares.

            
                
            
            
        
    










    
        
            
            
            
            
            
            
        
        
            
            Schooled in the streets
            Before he became known as Mr ‘SBTG’, Mark spent his youth exploring new skateboarding routes in the heart of the city. The route from the Supreme Court to the Padang is one he remembers fondly. “That whole route and journey is my playground,” he shares. “Every single time I go there it inspires me.”
