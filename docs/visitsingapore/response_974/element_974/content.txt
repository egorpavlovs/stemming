                                 The Singapore Experience Lab is an immersive showcase of Singapore’s hidden gems and must-dos for visitors. Through augmented reality, visitors may learn the secrets of our cultural neighbourhoods while projection mapping will enable visitors to have a deeper appreciation of our local delicacies. There is also something for the little ones, where they may colour activity sheets to uncover stories about our famous attractions, and admire their artworks interact on a digital wall projection. Other features include a time tunnel that shares Singapore’s history through to modern day metropolis, as well as a glimpse into tourism products visitors may expect in the future.
