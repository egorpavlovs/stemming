	A Destination of choice 
	Singapore is primed for this Congress due to the city’s good infrastructure and transport networks. It has invested heavily in its transport systems and is continually exploring ways to improve to keep the country moving. In the sixth edition of the Cities of Opportunity study by PricewaterhouseCoopers in 2014, Singapore ranked first in transportation and infrastructure and third overall among 30 cities measured. This study ranked cities on factors that contribute to creating successful and resilient urban communities. As a city with modern infrastructure and high public transportation usage, Singapore is also suitable as a test-bed for ITS infrastructure and advancements in research and development (R&D).

	
	
	

	
	
	
	Furthermore, the ITS World Congress 2019 will complement other land transport events held in Singapore, such as the Singapore International Transport Congress and Exhibition (SITCE). It furthers this momentum and cement Singapore’s reputation as a leading urban transportation hub.

	
	
	

	
	
	Strong government support
	This win is due to the combined efforts of various government organisations such as International Enterprise (IE) Singapore, the Ministry of Transport (MOT), and Singapore Tourism Board (STB), with the Land Transport Authority (LTA) as the lead agency. LTA was actively involved in the bidding process, while other agencies assisted with marketing, creating content and sourcing for sponsors. The bid proposal included strong leisure elements such as cruise programmes, trips to neighbouring destinations and other experiential elements. A portion of the profits earned from this event will be returned to the ITS community in the form of scholarships and exchange programmes.

	
	
	

	
	              
	                  "We will take this opportunity to showcase how we have been able to use smart technology and other innovative ways to transform our land transport systems and, in turn, improve travelling experience of all users,” explains LTA Chief Chew Men Leong.
	              
	          
	
	
	Through their involvement with the Congress, these government agencies will also learn ways to improve Singapore’s transport system across different areas. It will also be a prime opportunity for Singapore to showcase its strong commitment in ITS R&D and reinforce its position as an innovation hub and leader to the adoption of ITS technologies across the region. The Congress is an invaluable platform for local transport and ITS practitioners to leverage for access to overseas tenders and projects.
