	U.S. technology and engineering giant Emerson chose Singapore as its regional headquarters because of its first-rate logistics capabilities and because Singapore is “unlike anywhere else in the world” when it comes to engaging new technology and innovation.
Emerson began in Singapore in the year 1965 and has since progressed in tandem with Singapore and the Asia Pacific region. In November 2017, Emerson opened a customer-focused Solutions Center in Singapore, as part of its drive to make Singapore a hub for Industrial Internet of Things (IoT) technologies and services.
Emerson also established a collaborative project with Singapore Polytechnic to advance training for the digital workforce of the future, recognizing that Singapore provides the perfect complement to the company’s passion for innovation and its leading position in high-value manufacturing.
 
“Singapore is a country that has a tremendous business climate in terms of engaging to bring new technology and innovation, working closely with the universities. It's a partnership that we truly find unlike anywhere else in the world."
Ron Martin
 President, Asia Pacific
