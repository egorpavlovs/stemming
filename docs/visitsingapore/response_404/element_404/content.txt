Jahan Loh

            contemporary artist
            You might know Jahan as the man who turned a ‘Ma Ling’ luncheon meat tin into pop art. This iconic artwork was last shown at B-Side and Rarities, an exhibition at Ion Art Gallery which showcased Jahan’s various works of the last decade. As the first artist to bring street art to galleries in both Singapore and China, Jahan has been credited for taking Singapore Pop Art international, and has influenced modern art practices in Taiwan. In 2011, his works were selected by the Andy Warhol Foundation to be showcased in Andy Warhol's exhibition, 15 Minutes Eternal, at the ArtScience Museum™.

                            In a city where international fashion labels stand at every corner, many still choose to dress in the traditional garb of their community.

                            The din and drama of Chinese lion dances still draw hordes of local families, who believe the traditional ritual chases away evil spirits.

                            She may be all of 14, but Tan Wei Tian is injecting new life into Teochew opera, an artform that has centuries of history.
