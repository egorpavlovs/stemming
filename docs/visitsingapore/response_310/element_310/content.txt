	    World Congress of Physical Therapy 2015
	




	
	
	
	Singapore is known for its stellar healthcare standards. In 2012, it came in first in Bloomberg’s World’s Healthiest Countries Rankings. In 2014, it was also ranked as the most efficient healthcare system in the world. The nation’s priorities in building a sound healthcare system make it a very suitable host for the World Confederation for Physical Therapy (WCPT) Congress. 

	
	
	

	
	
	Overview
	The 17th WCPT Congress was held in Singapore from 1 to 4 May 2015 at the Suntec Singapore Convention and Exhibition Centre. The World Confederation for Physical Therapy is the sole international voice for physical therapy, and represents more than 380,000 physical therapists worldwide through its 111 member organisations. 
The Congress was a prime platform for physiotherapists from around the world to discuss important and challenging issues in the field through debates, panel discussions, symposiums and presentations on the latest research. A/Prof Goh Ah Cheng, former president of Singapore Physiotherapy Association (SPA), was the opening speaker for the event. 

	
	
	

	
	              
	                  “This is a proud moment for us, [as] we are a small and relatively young profession compared to the larger physiotherapy populations in other countries,” relates A/Prof Celia Tan, president of SPA. 
	              
	          
	
	Highlights
	The event attracted more than 3,400 delegates from 114 countries. During the three-day event, the delegates had the opportunity to attend 25 focused symposiums, 33 networking sessions, 11 discussion panels and debates, over 15 seminars and the presentation of more than 2,000 abstracts. The programme was designed to showcase the best in physical therapy research, education, practice and service delivery across the different branches of the profession. It was also a chance for delegates to network and meet colleagues from different parts of the world. 

	
	
	

	
	
	
	SPA also lined up many fun activities for the delegates to partake in during their stay in Singapore. This included a fun run around Marina Bay, Pilates, table tennis, qi gong and a competitive chaptek game.
In the exhibition hall, SPA set up a Singapore House and an online blog (askmeaboutSingapore.wordpress.com) to introduce the local culture and sights to attendees. Conferences held in Singapore not only benefit from world-class facilities and accommodation, it is also a bustling, multicultural city where international guests can feel right at home.
