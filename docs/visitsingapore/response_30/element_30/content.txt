	    Getting Around
	




	
	Taxi
	
	Taxis in Singapore are plentiful, comfortable, safe and easy to use. You can hail a taxi on the street or catch one from designated taxi stands in the city centre. Alternatively, you can book a taxi by calling the Dial-A-Cab hotline at +65 6342 5222 or texting "BOOKsix-digit postal code" to 71222. You could also use a mobile phone app like Comfort DelGro, Taxi Booking App, SMRT Book a Taxi or GrabTaxi. Booking charges apply for these services. In Singapore, fares are charged by the meter and start from 3SGD/2USD. Additional charges may apply depending on location as well as when you travel during peak hours and after midnight. Receipts are provided upon request. Limousine taxi services charge a flat rate, and can only be hired from an authorised limousine counter or over the phone. 

	
	
	

	
	Trains and buses
	
	It is easy to get around in Singapore by public transportation, with an extensive network of trains and buses connecting to almost every corner of the island. Safe and efficient, the trains connect the major areas of the island-city. The trains run from 6am to midnight, and cost a minimum of 1.4SGD/1USD for cash fares. Single trip tickets can be purchased from vending machines at all MRT stations. Comfortable buses travel to almost every part of the island, including the heartland. Cash fares start from 1.4SGD/1USD. Night buses from the city centre to the residential estates are available on Friday and Saturday nights, as well as on the eve of public holidays. If you are staying for a few days, consider getting an EZ-link card. A useful card for savings and convenience, the card can be used on both trains and buses, with fares starting from 77 cents. You can purchase the card at selected MRT stations, bus interchanges and 7-Eleven stores.

	
	
	

	
	The Singapore Tourist Pass
	
	Enjoy the sights and sounds without hassle by using the Singapore Tourist Pass. With the all-day Pass, you can save time and money as it offers you unlimited rides on Singapore's public transport system, including the MRT, LRT and basic bus services. It excludes travel on premium and niche bus services. The pass is available in three options – 1-day (10SGD/7USD), 2-days (16SGD/12USD) and 3-days (20SGD/14USD), with a refundable 10SGD/7USD deposit for the card. You can purchase the Singapore Tourist Pass from select TransitLink Ticket Offices located at MRT stations.
