		A testament to Singapore’s reputation as a City in a Garden, the Botanic Gardens is the country’s first UNESCO Heritage Site, joining the ranks of iconic landmarks such as Cambodia’s Angkor Wat and The Great Wall of China.

Established in 1859 by the Agri-Horticultural Society, 60 acres of land were transformed from a disused plantation into the popular recreational garden you see today.

As well as being a favourite recreation venue for jogging, dining or just lazing about, the sprawling grounds are also a leading centre for botanical and horticultural research.

Highlights include The National Orchid Garden, which boasts the world’s largest orchid display, with over 60,000 plants and orchid plants.

Meanwhile, the SBG Heritage Museum features interactive and multimedia exhibits and panels that detail the Gardens' rich heritage, while the CDL Green Gallery displays botanical-related exhibits.
Kids will have a blast at the Jacob Ballas Children’s Garden where they can play and learn all about plant life. A host of restaurants and cafes are also available to satisfy thirsty and hungry visitors after a day out in the sun.
And once you’re ready to step back into the concrete jungle, the Orchard Road shopping district is mere minutes away.

                The Tembusu tree at the Singapore Botanic Gardens is reportedly over 150 years old. Its creamy white flowers open at sunset (during the flowering season) and gives off a strong fragrance. Currently, there are more than 40 Heritage Trees found in the Gardens.

                                	National Orchid Garden
                                
                                
                                	With over 1,000 species and 2,000 hybrids on display, the splendour of Singapore’s national flower is a sight to behold at the National Orchid Garden.

                                	The Swan Lake is home to numerous species of aquatic plants and fishes, and is named as such because of a pair of beautiful mute swans from Amsterdam that glide gracefully across the lake.

                                	Built in 1921, the 240-square-metre Heritage Museum once served as the office and laboratory of the garden’s director, Professor Eric Holttum. This beautifully conserved colonial building now features a range of exhibits that highlight the garden’s history, and its role in establishing Singapore’s early rubber, sugar palm and orchid industries.
