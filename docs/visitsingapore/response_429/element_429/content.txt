                            The standard electrical current used in Singapore is 220-240 volts AC (50 cycles) and you can use power plugs with three square prongs here.

                        
                    
                     
                     
                          
                         
                    
        		

				
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Tipping
                        
                        
                            Tipping is encouraged when you experience good service, and this would be above the standard 10 percent gratuity to your bill added by some restaurants and hotels.
