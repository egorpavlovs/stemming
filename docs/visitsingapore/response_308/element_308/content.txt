	Highlights
	“Much has changed since [SPAR UK’s last visit to Singapore] in this fascinating and diverse city. Singapore is a vibrant, multi-cultural, cosmopolitan, sophisticated location with a real business culture,” says Dominic Hall, National Guild Chairman, SPAR UK. It is this unique combination of traits that allows Singapore to offer a cornucopia of leisure experiences in art and entertainment, culture, nightlife and shopping, to name a few.

	
	
	

	
	
	
	On opening night, delegates got to network during the welcome drinks reception at Shangri-La’s Rasa Sentosa Resort & Spa. The next day, they went on a full-day city tour, which included a leisurely ride on Singapore Flyer observation wheel, a dim sum lunch in Chinatown and a bumboat river ride. The third and fourth days were devoted to the conference itself, hosted by the well-known journalist Michael Buerk.
Retail partners were brought to Orchard Road, Singapore’s world-famous shopping precinct, to look at the malls and department stores that carry a diverse range of local and international retail brands.

	
	
	

	
	
	
	The two conference days were capped with a Roaring Twenties-themed night at Raffles Hotel, followed by a “Handbags and Gladrags” gala dinner at Shangri-La’s Rasa Sentosa Resort & Spa, which included a charity auction. For the inter-guild challenge on the fifth day, participants had an exciting afternoon of dragon boat racing in Siloso Beach lagoon, after which they enjoyed a beach barbecue dinner.

	
	
	

	
	
	The results
	The SPAR UK Convention 2014 was widely described by participants as the best to date, with many posting personal photos and highly positive tweets about the event on Twitter. Feedback forms came back with an overall excellent rating, including a 100 per cent score for the Singapore venue and choice in hotel. Four out of five event highlights received scores above 97 per cent. Impressed by the flexibility and teamwork demonstrated by Shangri-La’s Rasa Sentosa Resort & Spa team, and noting the stamp of approval from the attendees, SPAR UK continues to keep Singapore in mind as a future convention destination in Asia.
