		Sports fanatics can expect thrills, spills and world-class football matches at the International Champions cup, an annual sports extravaganza that hosts top teams from around the world, as they face off at the National Stadium.
The 2018 competition featured English Premier League legend Arsenal, illustrious Spanish La Liga team Atlético de Madrid and French Ligue 1 giants Paris Saint-Germain, as they battled for pride and top honours. The event saw tens of thousands of football fans congregating at the National Stadium to roar their support for the three rival titans of the sport.
The riveting, head-to-head matchups had Atlético de Madrid edging out Arsenal 3-1 on penalties following a 1-1 draw, and Arsenal trouncing Paris Saint-Germain 5-1 in a resounding victory. The Parisian team got their payback in the last match of the event, with a 3-2 victory over Atlético de Madrid.
Besides high-octane action, football fever also spread through the rest of the city, with a range of exciting activities off the pitch. This included live music performances, autograph signing sessions and photo opportunities with stars from all three clubs. A dedicated fanzone at the stadium and pop-ups in the city offered football-themed games that allowed spectators to get in on the action and break out their own moves.

                                Football fanatics in the house! 
                                As part of the football-themed festivities, the House of Football pop-up opened its doors to fans at Clarke Quay. Challengers laced up and went head-to-head for the main event – the Panna. Played in a decagonal (10-sided) cage, players attempted to nutmeg and score through the legs of their opponents in one-on-one and two-on-two match-ups. Other exhilarating activities at Clarke Quay include foosball, photo opportunities with club memorabilia from all three clubs and themed nights hosted by the Spanish La Liga and Paris Saint-Germain.

                            
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        
                        
                            
                                
                                    
                                
                            
                            
                                Experiencing Singapore’s rich tradition
                                The International Champions Cup gave visiting soccer stars the chance to experience the many sights, sounds and flavours of the Lion City. Visiting La Liga ambassador and former Valencia midfielder Gaizka Mendieta, for one, tried his hand at traditional games like chapteh (a game that involves keeping a feathered shuttlecock in the air with the heel of one’s foot) and sepak takraw (a Southeast Asian sport resembling volleyball, employing a players’ feet, knees, chest and head to score against an opposing team).
The visiting legends sampled a traditional breakfast of kaya toast and attempted to whip up local beverages, like kopi o kosong (black coffee without sugar), in true blue Singaporean fashion. 

                            
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        
                        
                            
                                
                                    
                                
                            
                            
                                Legends living it up
                                Football wasn’t the only thing that the star competitors of International Champions Cup 2018 got up to while they were in Singapore. Eight Arsenal players visited the hip enclave of Haji Lane in the historic Kampong Glam precinct for a series of fun-filled challenges, which involved selfies at the iconic Sultan Mosque, buying souvenirs, getting passers-by to snap their photos and trying cups of coffee with customised latte art.
The stars of Paris Saint-Germain were also spotted playing futsal and trying their hands at making both prata (Indian flatbread) and teh tarik (frothy pulled tea).
