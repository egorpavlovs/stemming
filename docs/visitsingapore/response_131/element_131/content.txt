	    Overview
	






	    Media hub making headlines
	




	
	
	The Asia Pacific region’s rapidly growing middleclass of some 600 million new consumers is providing content producers with new audiences on every media platform, and fuelling the industry’s growth.
	Internet demand is booming too: Southeast Asia’s online populations are growing at rates that far outpace the global average. The ASEAN ICT Masterplan 2020 seeks to propel the region in a digitally enabled economy that is secure, sustainable and transformative, and to cultivate an innovative, inclusive and integrated ASEAN community3. 

	
	
	




	
	
	Broadcasting business opportunities to Asia
	Sophisticated digital infrastructure, a multi-cultural society and high technological penetration have made Singapore a popular base from which to roll out international content and Asia-specific material. Activities in Singapore span the entire media cycle, from design conception, production and post-production, to distribution, sales and marketing.

	
	
	

	
	
	A network of media minds
	More than 7,000 media companies have set up shop in Singapore. These include content creators in the film and/or television industries, 3D animation, cutting-edge video games, trans-media storytelling and new media initiatives. Leading digital media companies such as Lucasfilm, Tecmo-Koei, Double Negative, Electronic Arts and Ubisoft have also opened here while top specialty schools like DigiPen help Singapore build a world-class talent base. Some 14 of the top 15 global communications services agencies networks (ranked by Adage) have established their regional hubs here too. An increasingly flourishing home-grown industry also features promising enterprises recognised by prestigious rankings like the Deloitte Technology Fast 500 Asia Pacific programme.

	
	
	






	    Media & Digital Content Business Events: Opportunities for growth
	




	
	
	Current business events landscape
	Singapore boasts world-class digital infrastructure, and a population that is multi-cultural, global in outlook and digitally sophisticated. It offers exhibitors, delegates and buyers an ideal platform to capture the growing base of Asian and global consumers with globally-competitive content.
Proximity to the Asia Pacific consumer market is also fuelling the growth of Media & Digital Content events, including ConnecTechAsia, which is the umbrella event forBroadcastAsia, CommunicAsia and NXTAsia, and events under the Singapore Media Festival such as Asia TV Forum & Market, ScreenSingapore, Singapore International Film Festival and the Asian Television Awards. Fans too are being drawn into the frenzy when celebrities are in town, such as during All That Matters, Music Matters and Gaming Matters.

	
	
	

	
	
	Opportunities
	Today’s consumers are multi-platform users – from mobile devices to big-format screens. There is therefore interest in business events that cover the gamut from advertising, online gaming and transmedia development, to intellectual property management and licensing. At the same time, deep dives into digital media, such as game development, app development, mobile as a platform and social media, and their applications across different sectors and market segments will be particularly relevant in today’s digital age.

	
	
	

	
	Did you know?
	
	
Between 2010 and 2020, it is estimated that there will be 194 million new Internet users within the ASEAN region1.
More than 1.5 billion people across the Asia Pacific region now use social media on a monthly basis, with 95% of them accessing platforms via mobile devices - the highest ratio in the world2.
