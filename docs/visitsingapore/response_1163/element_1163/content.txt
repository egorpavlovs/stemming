		Flaunt that beach bod and slip into your comfiest flip flops—ZoukOut returns this year with a line-up of electronic dance music (EDM) A-listers. Ravers need no introduction to ZoukOut. Organised by Zouk, a homegrown club that has consistently ranked among the world’s best, this dusk-till-dawn music festival has been a mainstay in the global party-goer’s calendar since 2000.

		The 18th edition of the festival will see DVLM, Galantis, Jeffrey Sutorius, KSHMR and Timmy Trumpet, among other international DJ heavyweights, hitting the decks. Not to mention the many bars, food stalls and stages spread across the sprawling festival grounds of Siloso Beach on Sentosa.
This year, ZoukOut is set to bring its iconic Mambo Jambo series back with the Mambo Jambo Beach Party. Held at AJ Hackett Sentosa, the event delivers a family-friendly beach party right at Siloso Beach, Sentosa. Programmed to evoke a sense of nostalgia by bridging the past and present, the party is lined back-to-back with the iconic Mambo Jambo (80s hits) and Total Recall (90s hits). Fronted by local veterans and a line-up of respective Zouk alumni behind each era, Tony Tay, Brendon P and Leonard will be making their comeback at ZoukOut’s Mambo Jambo deck. Alongside would be Zouk’s legendary resident, Jeremy Boon and the duo of Lincey and The Dinosaur for Total Recall.

		ZoukOut Singapore will be collaborating with celebrated restaurants, Burnt Ends and FOC Sentosa (FOC Group), for an exclusive pop-up dining experience. As part of ZoukOut 2018 on 1 December, up to 150 guests will get to enjoy a full-service, four hands dinner set against a panoramic sunset and festival backdrop.
	


        Origins of a series

		
        

		
        

		
        

		
		ZoukOut began life as a modest, one-night-only event that attracted just 9,000 revellers, but it didn’t take long for it to build a following on the global party scene, drawing tens of thousands now annually. Techno legend Richie Hawtin headlined the very first edition, and the Canadian is now joined by some of the biggest names including Above&Beyond, Paul Oakenfold, Armin van Buuren, Carl Cox, Tiësto and David Guetta. Spinning alongside are local DJs such as Aldrin, LeNERD, KoFlow, DuriO and Haan.
So successful has ZoukOut been that the Singapore Tourism Awards has twice crowned it the “Best Leisure Event Experience” in the city. Such is its appeal that ZoukOut has also been staged internationally, in Hong Kong, Boracay and Tokyo.
