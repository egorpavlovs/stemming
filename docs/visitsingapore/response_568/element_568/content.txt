	    Opening Borders & Possibilities
	




	
	
	
	Home to the world's best airport, Singapore Changi Airport, which is situated in the heart of the ASEAN region, millions of business and leisure travelers benefit each year from Singapore's wide-reaching connectivity as they transit to neighboring countries and greater parts of Asia and the world. That reputation as an established travel hub appears to be strengthening as the global travel industry undergoes a digital transformation.
 
 Today, many people book trips themselves online and through mobile devices, and the trend is only going to grow as millennials take charge of their own travel planning.

	Worldwide, online travel bookings are forecast to grow almost 11 percent a year over the next five years, and Euromonitor International sees Asia Pacific as the fastest-growing market2 for the travel intermediary business, with more than half the world’s millennials2living in the region. This has persuaded companies like Expedia to establish and grow their presence in Asia Pacific.
Expedia Group, with investments around US$1 billion a year in technology,2 has invested heavily in talent and technology in Asia, and it has opened the company's first Asia-based 'Expedia Innovation Lab' in Singapore in 2017. It leverages Singapore's strategic location and first-rate connectivity across a range of local, regional and international areas of business focus. Singapore is the Asia-Pacific base for the iconic Expedia brand/business.
 
“Singapore has a decisively pro-enterprise and creative mindset. The way that they leverage technology to build customer value is quite incredible. For us, customer means traveler, and that unique approach of putting travelers first as Singapore does really marries well with our own philosophy.”
Jonty Neal
 CEO
 Expedia Asia
