	Nasi Lemak Tea by Ette Tea

	
	
	




	
	
	
	Nasi Lemak, a dish of coconut milk-infused rice served with crisp fried fish, peanuts, anchovies and sweet chilli paste, is a decadent breakfast favourite enjoyed by locals. Ette Tea has intriguingly composed a tea blend that distinctly captures nasi lemak’s nuanced savoury taste. Brew the concoction and let the aromas transport you back to a busy Singapore kopitiam (coffee shop) where rice for breakfast is a common affair. 
Grab a 50g caddy for S$26, or explore other unusual tastes on EtteTea or at Naiise outlets at Orchard Gateway and Wheelock Place.

	Neighbourwood Toy Blocks by ATAS

	
	
	




	
	
	
	Treat the little ones to some old school playtime with wooden blocks in the shape of iconic Singaporean buildings. Aptly created by ATAS (All Things About Singapore), these collectible pieces currently feature the Marina Bay or Beach Road skylines. Each set also comes with specifically printed district maps, which the toy buildings can be placed on, to highlight Singapore’s distinct urban landscape. 
Purchase your own plot on The Farm Store for $28 each.
