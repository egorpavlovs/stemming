Lovers of fine wine, rejoice! Singapore is home to dozens of bars devoted to vino the world over, from French varietals to South American labels to New World bottles. You can get an affordable glass of Chardonnay just as easily as a princely bottle of Henri Jayer Cros Parantoux—if you know where to look. Here are six bars to clink your glasses at.

                    This red-splashed bar is perfect for the novice drinker. You can order tasting portions (from S$4/25 millilitres) or half-portions (from S$9/75 millilitres) of any of the 350 labels in its walk-in cellar—ideal if you’re looking to sample a variety of Praelum Wine Bistro's reds, whites, rosés, desserts and sparkling wines. There’s also the “Learn-a-Drink” option (S$13/75 millilitres); every week, the sommeliers provide tasting notes for a chosen beverage. Praelum is also passionate about its grower sparkling wines (S$23/glass), stocking the likes of NV De Stafani Prosecco Brut Zero, which is known for its fresh, vibrant notes.
Praelum. 4 Duxton Hill, Singapore 089590. +65 6238 5287.

                    A glass cube housing more than 700 labels of wine dominates the casual, neutral-toned space of Verre Modern Bistro and Wine Bar—and for good reason. The bar is dead serious when it comes to vino, curating a wine list with terroir as its main consideration. Almost all its bottles (S$75-S$5,350) hail from France, with the menu broken down into the country’s many winemaking regions. You’ll find wines from lesser-known regions such as Barsac and Loire Valley alongside the more common ones from Burgundy and Bourdeaux. However, only a few varietals, such as a Marcel Deiss Muscat (S$19) and a Pauillac de Latour Cabernet blend (S$49), are available by the glass.
Verre Modern. 8 Rodyk Street Singapore 238216. +65 6509 1917. 
 Mon-Thu 5pm-midnight; Fri 5pm-1am; Sat 3pm-1am; Sun 3-11pm.

                    Wood-clad and understated, La Terre offers a well-curated selection of mostly Old World wines. For the connoisseurs, the bar carries many rare vintages, like a 1999 Henri Jayer Cros Parantoux, which is a savoury Pinot Noir from Burgundy (S$27,373). But don’t worry, casual drinkers—La Terre also offers wine by the glass (from SGD 18). There is also a substantial collection of Champagnes (S$82-SGD 2,764/bottle) from labels such as Armand de Brignac and Larmandier-Bernier available here.
La Terre. 11 Upper Circular Road, Singapore 058409. +65 6532 1031.

                “Affordability” is the name of the game for this chain of casual bistros. Bottles at its popular Wine Connection Cheese Bar outlet start at just S$30 and peak at S$130. You’ll find solid Chardonnays such as a Château Grenouilles Chablis Grand Cru (S$130/bottle) alongside assertive Merlot blends like a 2009 Château Pique Segue (S$33/bottle). Wines from the US, South America, New Zealand and Australia, among others, are also on the menu here. For a drink rich in complexity and dark fruit notes, we recommend ordering the 2011 Castle Rock Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (S$50/bottle) from Napa Valley.
