	Singapore to host premiere of Industrial Transformation Asia Pacific – a HANNOVER MESSE event
Securing Asian edition of world’s largest tradeshow for industrial technology is a strategic boost for Singapore’s manufacturing sector
Singapore is slated to host the 2018 premiere of Industrial Transformation Asia Pacific – A HANNOVER MESSE Event. The Singapore Tourism Board (STB) and Deutsche Messe AG have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to organise Industrial Transformation Asia Pacific for three years in Singapore. The agreement covers the development of new content and exhibition components for the tradeshow, marketing and publicity efforts, as well as possible areas of collaboration in terms of industry knowledge exchange and new tradeshows.
New event a central platform for advanced manufacturing in Asia Pacific
As part of Singapore's Committee on the Future Economy report, Advanced Manufacturing was identified as a key driver of Singapore's future economic growth. Industrial Transformation Asia Pacific will provide a strategic boost to Singapore's manufacturing sector by serving as its anchor event.
The event will help to catalyse the transformation of Singapore's manufacturing sector by providing a platform for leading manufacturers and technology providers to discover the latest technologies and concepts, and to identify potential partners for co-innovation. It also brings together global leaders to share successful case studies and best practices in Asia, which can be adopted globally.
"The Committee on the Future Economy (CFE) had emphasised Singapore's commitment to develop a globally-competitive manufacturing hub.  In that regard, Deutsche Messe's partnership with SingEx Group to stage the Asian edition of the HANNOVER MESSE in Singapore is a welcome development.  It will help to showcase emerging technologies and catalyse the adoption of advanced manufacturing in Singapore, by bringing together global thought leaders and key industry stakeholders. The event will also be a significant boost to our business events pipeline," said Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) Mr S Iswaran.
The government agencies involved include STB, the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB), International Enterprise (IE) Singapore, SPRING Singapore and the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR).
Deutsche Messe AG collaborates with SingEx
Deutsche Messe AG, owner and organiser of HANNOVER MESSE in Germany, and Singapore trade event company SingEx Group are partners in the event. The premiere of Industrial Transformation Asia Pacific marks the latest addition to a robust line-up of tradeshow partnerships in Singapore.
"We are pleased to announce this partnership with SingEx, which stems from a year of discussions. Industrial Transformation is an important business platform in the Asia Pacific that highlights how the Fourth Industrial Revolution is changing production, logistics and knowledge transfer," said Dr. Jochen Köckler, CEO, Deutsche Messe AG.
"We are confident of a strong participation from the regional industries as they look forward to an exciting and innovative event platform. We would like to thank the Singapore Government for their unstinting support of the event and our partnership." said Mr Aloysius Arlando, SingEx's CEO.
