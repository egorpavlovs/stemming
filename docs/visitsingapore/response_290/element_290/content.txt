	Why organise conferences
	For Professor Shum, organising conferences is a chance to create a platform for professors, scientists and students to meet and share ideas, facilitate collaboration and have personal discussions. It’s also a chance to showcase Singapore’s world-class facilities and to show the international community what Singapore is capable of. 

Aside from showcasing our universities’ world-class facilities, bringing in great thinkers and scientists allows Singaporean students to interact with other students from other parts of the world as well as delegates. It’s also a chance to showcase what Singapore has to offer. 
	
	
	




	
	
	How Singapore won the bid
	Professor Shum worked closely with representatives from STB, who gave advice based on their experience in bidding for events, suggestions on how to improve the bid documents and arranged for colleagues from STB’s international network of offices to join the initial meetings. The help from STB made it possible for Professor Shum to showcase Singapore’s many attractions as a host venue and helped Singapore win the bid.

	
	
	

	
	              
	                  Singapore is impressive and is most suitable for a conference because it is the safest country in the world.
	              
	          
	
	Why Singapore was selected
	Some of the factors that helped Singapore secure the bid were our reputation as one of the safest countries in the world with a low crime rate, our multilingual and multiracial society so delegates will have no problems communicating; and efficient transport and communication systems, for ease in travelling and connectivity.

	
	
	





        
        
            
	        
	                
                        Since [the delegates] are here, we bring them to our centre, and this helps our university’s reputation to grow. Professors influence the global rankings of universities and as they are the ones who rank them. If they have never been to Singapore, they may not be able to comment too much on its universities.
