	    Conference on Laser and Electro-Optics Pacific Rim 2017
	




	
	
	Overview
	Good news for Singapore’s MICE industry — the 12th Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics Pacific Rim (CLEO PR) will come to Singapore in 2017. This prestigious event adds another feather in the cap of Singapore’s vibrant MICE industry. The successful bid was led by Professor Perry Shum, director/professor, Photonics Centre of Excellence, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University. The successful bid is an excellent case study on how stakeholders in Singapore’s MICE industry and the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) came together to attract more event showpieces to the island.

	
	
	

	
	
	
	A biannual conference based in the United States, and attended by around 1,000 delegates, CLEO PR is an international forum for scientific and technical optics, and the conference unites the fields of lasers and photo-electronics. It brings together all aspects of laser technology — from basic research to industry applications. During the conference, attendees hear and present groundbreaking research from scientists, share ideas and network with colleagues and experts. The conference also features an expo so delegates and the public can see the latest technology demonstrated. In 2013, the conference was held in Japan, while South Korea hosts in 2015. Singapore finally won the opportunity to host the 12th iteration of the conference in 2017 — thanks to the efforts of Professor Shum and his team.

	
	
	

	
	
	
	Professor Shum is a member of the Conference Ambassadors Programme, a network of top professionals in key industries (e.g., medical, engineering, etc) who advocates for Singapore to host conferences and events in their professional networks abroad. Among his successes, Professor Shum was key in creating the Photonics Global Conference@Singapore, a biannual event, which started in 2010 and is now a signature photonics conference. He is a founding member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Singapore, the biggest engineering society in the world and has served in various positions in international conferences. Because of his drive in organising major MICE events in Singapore, Professor Shum was recognised as a Business Events Ambassador in the 2013 Singapore Experience Awards organised by the Singapore Tourism Board.
