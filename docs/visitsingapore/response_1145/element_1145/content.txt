                Kampong Glam

                A leisurely 10-minute walk away from Bugis MRT is an ethnic enclave turned shopping haven. Lined with an eclectic mix of generations-old heritage stores, independent boutiques and crafts shops, Kampong Glam’s shophouses are a welcome change from air-conditioned shopping centres. Much of its charm as the former home of the local Sultan (King) has been retained, yet new tenants inject fresh allure into one of Singapore’s most iconic heritage neighbourhoods. Wander through back alleys and along five-foot ways offering trinkets that you won’t usually find in any malls. Start from the shops around the biggest landmark, Sultan Mosque, and work your way into the narrow alleyways that are full of curious finds.
