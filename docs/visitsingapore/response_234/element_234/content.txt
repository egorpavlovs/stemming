	Blending rich history with exciting modernity, National Gallery Singapore is a renewed icon for the 21st century. The Gallery is housed in two of Singapore’s most historic buildings — the former Supreme Court and City Hall — and oversees the largest public collection of modern Southeast Asian art.
The Gallery’s prime location, in the heart of the Civic District, and stunning state-of-the-art spaces make it an ideal host for a wide variety of events. The Gallery offers a multitude of venues — from the expansive Supreme Court Terrace to the Coleman and Padang decks on the rooftop — that cater to all organisers’ needs. Guests will be able to unwind and enrich themselves through the museum’s rich collection with tours guided by the Gallery’s docents.
The beautiful interplay of majestic neoclassical architecture and sleek contemporary design will add an air of sophistication and grandeur to any occasion.
