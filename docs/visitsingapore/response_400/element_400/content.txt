                    "I've always thought of architecture as brushstrokes on the canvas of a city's urban plan and Singapore's canvas is as exciting as it is well planned - it provides an array of environments for architects to respond to, from historically rich heritage neighborhoods to vibrant mixed-use waterfront precincts. Architecture should be more than artful assemblages of steel and glass... the very best examples of Singaporean architecture serve as milestones: physical manifestoes of our nation's collective aspirations and dreams."

                    "Contemporary Singapore is a city striving to become more and more sustainable and liveable, economically, socially, environmentally, and culturally. Singapore’s architectural landscape will continue to evolve, adding new layers upon layers on its historical and cosmopolitan urban fabric, making this city uniquely local and perpetually global. There is no other place like Singapore."
