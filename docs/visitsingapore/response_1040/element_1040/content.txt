True to its ‘City in a Garden’ moniker, Singapore is a marriage of lush tropical foliage and bustling metropolis. This emphasis on greenery is moving beyond the streets of our city and onto our plates, thanks to a growing number of chefs and restaurateurs who are whipping up cuisine inspired by what we find in Singapore’s natural surroundings.

                    Southeast Asian fruits, flowers, pods, herbs and spices are the pride and joy of this gelato parlour. Its freshly churned, botanical-inspired gelato (S$4.70/scoop) pays homage by using ingredients and flavours native to our region. So instead of hazelnut and chocolate, you can pick from lychee raspberry, pandan, white chrysanthemum, strawberry basil, and other refreshing tropical flavours. To lift those floral notes, ask for your gelato to be heaped on a crispy thyme cone for an extra dollar.

                Located in the heart of the Gardens by the Bay, this fine dining restaurant serves up exquisite plates that are as vibrant and vivid as its surroundings. Executive chef Steve Allen, previously from the one-Michelin-starred Claridge’s in London, pushes out bold flavours with his innovative use of vegetables, as evidenced in his vaunted artichoke, basil and pickled pear dishes, as well as Pollen’s Vegetarian Tasting Menu (S$155). The degustation includes dishes such as Pollen’s Garden, which is an assortment of seasonal vegetables paired with salt-baked celeriac, black garlic, black truffle, grapes, pecorino and walnuts—all of which you can tuck into while soaking in views of the Marina Bay waterfront.
After a meal here, explore the Flower Dome (you’ve already made it in, after all) and stroll through the sub-20ºC Mediterranean garden that’s set with exotic flowers and plants.

                The Halia (it’s also the Malay word for “ginger”) is located in the Ginger Garden of the Singapore Botanic Gardens, which is home to over 250 species of the root. The restaurant takes the nature theme seriously: even the layout of its architecture conforms to the contours of the land, preserving the trees and foliage around it. 
The food, on the other hand, combines refined European techniques with Southeast Asian ingredients and flavours—with many forms of ginger on the plate. Its dish of lemongrass & ginger prawn salad (S$16, for instance, is accompanied by ginger flower dressing , while its oven-baked halibut fillet (S$33) swims in a ginger-perfumed broth. Plus, you’re guaranteed excellent views of the surrounding greenery thanks to the floor-to-ceiling windows. It doesn’t get more idyllic than this.

                    An indoor food truck park, Picnic is an all-in-one dining destination which offers a different experience depending on where you sit. The café’s landscaping is replete with fresh flowers and potted plants that validate its name. It’s the handiwork of Singaporean florist Harijanto Setiawan, whose designs have won international awards such as the Silver Gilt Medal at Chelsea Flower Show London 2013.
Whether you choose to nosh on a lobster grilled cheese sandwich (S$18) in the flower conservatory or sip on tea as you lounge on the lawn, the café’s ambient lighting mimics the weather and time of the day—it’s almost as though you’re picnicking in the great outdoors. Order hearty sharing plates such as pepperoni pizzas (S$14) and whole French-style roast chickens (S$29.90), then complete your meal with desserts such as crêpes topped with berries and nuts (S$4-8). For boozy beverages, a small bar at the back of the space offers draught beer, wine and cocktails.

                    Wildseed brings together a café, patisserie, cocktail bar and urban farm into one space, with produce from the farm making its way onto the plates and into the glasses. Sip on nature-inspired tipples like Wild Thing (S$20), a gin cocktail tinged with chambord, raspberry, lime juice and lemon squeeze, and chow down on gourmet meaty sandwiches (S$15-18) before grabbing a dessert. The desserts shine through with local influences, too. Banana loaf (S$7.50) is topped with shavings of ginger flower, while a coconut muffin (S$7.50) is coloured blue thanks to the addition of pea flower, an ingredient traditionally used in Peranakan* cuisine.

                    At this open-concept restaurant in the Dempsey enclave of restaurants and bars, the chefs use ingredients plucked from a plot of land just steps from your table. Open Farm Community’s garden is located right beside the dining area, so it comes as no surprise that veggie-forward dishes are its calling cards. Try the mud crab tagliolini (S$25), buttermilk pancakes (S$22), red grouper burger (S$30) and pulled-pork eggs benedict (S$32).
Dempsey Hill. 130E Minden Road, Singapore 248819. +65 6471 0306. 
 Mon-Thu noon-4pm, 6-11pm; Fri noon-4pm, 6pm-midnight; Sat 11am-5pm, 6pm-midnight; Sun 11am-5pm, 6-11pm.
