                Let’s get this party started at the heart of the city centre.
                  
			
		

		
        

		
		With unmatched festival design and stage production, a lineup of the globe’s most legendary DJs, and an audience of dance music enthusiasts, Ultra Singapore is one of the island’s most widely anticipated outdoor dance parties.
First launched as Road to ULTRA in Singapore, the event saw some massive hype back in 2015, with 11,000 tickets sold out in a mere 21 minutes, and has since become a staple for EDM lovers, rave hunters and partygoers.
Riding on its success, Ultra Singapore went full-scale from 2016 onwards, with over 45,000 electronic music fanatics in attendance, making it the biggest full-scale Ultra festival in the Southeast Asia.
As with the past editions, Ultranauts can expect a lineup of the world’s most renowned DJs and electronic music artistes playing across three specially curated stages, each equipped with state-of-the-art interactive technology.
The outdoor music event is held in the heart of the city, at Marina Bay Sands, against Singapore’s stunning and futuristic skyline. Fitting as Ultra Singapore 2018 was the only Ultra festival outside of Miami to feature the brand new Worldwide Stage.
Here’s a breakdown of what to expect at Ultra Singapore.

        KEEP CALM AND PARTY ON

		
        

		
        

		
        

		
		Keep your Ultra party high going in a city that never sleeps. Ultra Park’s location at Marina Bay Sands is a stone’s throw away from some of Singapore’s most vibrant nightlife and supper options.

Party Animals Unite
Whether you’re a lover of underground tech-house or mainstream EDM, there are a ton of clubbing spots for the discerning night owl. Keep those dancing shoes on and hit Zouk, Singapore’s popular nightclub at Clarke Quay, or drop by Kampong Glam’s Blu Jaz café for some underground beats.
Grab A Cocktail Fix
Singapore is home to some of the world’s most acclaimed bartenders, which makes her range of bespoke cocktail bars a great option for ravers looking to wet their whistle with some locally inspired cocktails.
