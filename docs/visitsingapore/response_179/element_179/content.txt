	    Flight Centre Global Rally 2016

	Event Overview
	
	The Flight Centre Global Rally is one of the most anticipated annual gatherings on Flight Centre’s social calendar. The event gathers thousands of Flight Centre’s top-performing global achievers in a single location to celebrate their hard work and success in grand fashion.
In July this year, 3,300 Flight Centre employees congregated at Marina Bay Sands in Singapore for an action-packed and fun-filled four-day event. This was the integrated resort’s second time playing host to the Flight Centre Global Gathering. Marina Bay Sands’ accessibility, along with its best-in-class MICE facilities and extensive suite of offerings within a single destination, made it an ideal choice of location for Flight Centre to hold its biggest company event to date in Singapore.
Themed “The Fast & the Furious: Experience the Extraordinary”, the event opened with a welcome party held at Gardens by the Bay, against the backdrop of the magnificent Marina Bay Sands. The group continued to party through the night in the sky atop the iconic Sands SkyPark.
The Global Gathering took up over 32,303 square metres of event space at the Sands Expo and Convention Centre, including the Sands Grand Ballroom and Expo Halls. A total of 4,509 room nights were booked for the entire event.
Delegates attended an inspiring conference held at the Sands Grand Ballroom with celebrity guest speakers including Oscar award-winning actress Gwyneth Paltrow. The high-energy celebration culminated with a gala dinner, after which attendees were treated to exclusive live performances by American musician Jason Derulo and famous DJ Fatboy Slim in Hall C of the Sands Expo and Convention Centre.
