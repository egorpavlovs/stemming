Kyra

            World’s Fastest Flyer
            Kyra can certainly fly. The indoor skydiving champion rides winds as fast as 230 kilometres per hour at least five times a week, and holds the record for most number of backward somersaults done in a wind tunnel (the number’s 68). Through grit, determination and countless hours of training to perfect her airborne maneuvers, Kyra came in first at the indoor skydiving World Cup in August 2016. Two months after, she won a gold medal at the indoor skydiving World Cup, and bagged two gold medals at the Wind Games 2017, earning the title of World’s Fastest Flyer.


            
        
    








    
        
            
                Inspired by 
boundless potential

            
            
                “My dream was to become an astronaut, because I thought that was the only way I could fly,” Kyra shares. It was her dream of flying—and the limitless potential of indoor skydiving—that first captured eight-year-old Kyra’s attention. “There’s no end to what you can learn with indoor skydiving. It’s like a combination of many sports.” The fearless flyer hopes to expand her horizons, and to experience all that her sport can offer: “My dream is to be able to travel to all the different tunnels around the world. There are over 100 of them!”

                            She may be the world's fastest flyer, but Kyra Poh begins each day with her feet on the ground. The competitive indoor skydiver trains as hard as any athlete, never mind that she's only a teenager.

                            Unlike most teens, Kyra isn't interested in the latest fashion trends as she spends most of her time in a skydiving suit.

                            After all the dizzying action, Kyra prefers staying rooted to tradition, fuelling up on local staples from restaurants like The Tiong Bahru Club.

                Kyra's 
adventure spots

            
            
                From aerial yoga to rollercoaster rides, this thrill-seeker’s Singapore is filled with adrenaline and excitement.

                
            
        
    







    
        
            
            
            
            
            
            
        
        
            
            Stretches and suspensions 
            Aerial yoga definitely helped me to experiment with new tricks” Kyra observes. “It taught me to be comfortable stretching when I’m [suspended] above the ground.” Upside Motion—a studio which offers aerial yoga classes—helped Kyra to improve her aerial routine through rigorous trial and error.

            
                
            
            
        
    










    
        
            
            
            
            
            
            
        
        
            
            Wind beneath their wings
            “Passion is very important, but I think you have to put in effort and commitment,” Kyra tells us of what drives her to excel. To help develop this drive in others, the indoor skydiving champ informally coaches her younger peers at iFly Singapore, where she trains five out of seven days a week.

            
                
            
            
        
    










    
        
            
            
            
            
            
            
        
        
            
            Outdoor thrills at Sentosa
            For thrills beyond indoor skydiving, Kyra enjoys visiting Mega Adventure Park─Singapore, home to various adventure attractions like the MegaZip—a 75-metre-high zipline. “I hang around Sentosa because it’s near iFly [where I train],” Kyra says. “I’m here five to seven days a week. It’s my playground.”

            
                
            
            
        
    










    
        
            
            
            
            
            
            
        
        
            
            Rollercoaster romps at USS
            “I’ve always enjoyed rollercoasters. I’m a bit of a daredevil,” Kyra confesses. To understand Kyra’s love for flying, head down to Universal Studios Singapore™ (USS) for your own adrenaline rush. It was a childhood rollercoaster ride that influenced the young champ’s decision to pick up her sport.
