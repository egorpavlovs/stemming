	    Destination Choice
	






	    We spoke to Sven Bossu, Head of Sibos, SWIFT, to discover the top five reasons why the team chose Singapore as the destination for Sibos 2015:
	




	
	A strategic fit:  The financial heart of a buzzing region
	
	“Singapore is the beating heart of one of the most dynamic growth regions globally. Asian economies continue to lead global innovation, with one fifth of the world’s most innovative markets located in Asia, according to the Global Innovation Index 2014 (GII). The index ranked Singapore the highest in the region, at number seven globally, meaning that it maintained its place as the leading APAC nation.”
“Singapore has long been a leader in cutting-edge technology which facilitates the latest industry trends, such as mobile payments, and so provided a very strong platform for Sibos 2015. The city offers a thriving marketplace, characterised by a strong ecosystem of banks and technology companies, universities and research organisations – the necessary elements for a vibrant financial sector. This makes it a perfect fit for Sibos.”

	
	
	

	
	A safe and attractive city, which encapsulates the dynamism of the region
	
	“With a progressive legal system, intellectual property laws and a business-friendly culture, it came as no surprise that in 2014 Singapore was, for the ninth year running, rated by the World Bank as the easiest place in the world to do business. The government is extremely proactive in supporting and developing innovation, creating an environment which attracts both ambitious corporations and entrepreneurs.”
“For example, if you visit the city’s disruption hub at OneNorth, you will find an innovation corridor that is alive with start-ups, all neighbouring the impressive INSEAD Asian campus. In terms of the corporates, DBS recently held its first ‘megahackathon’, bringing employees and start-ups together to create innovative solutions for the next generation of banking. The final was judged by the company’s CEO, Mr Piyush Gupta, who we are delighted to have secured as the opening plenary address speaker at Sibos.”
“Singapore is also a great location in which to combine work and play. The best conversations often happen outside of a formal setting, and we leveraged Singapore’s stunning range of amenities for a number of our social and networking events. The diverse culture, food and nightlife of Singapore made Sibos 2015 a memorable experience for the delegates.”

	
	
	

	
	An exceptional venue to meet the demanding requirements of a Sibos event!
	
	“The world-renowned Marina Bay Sands is one of the leading business destinations in Asia, and our chosen location for Sibos 2015 Singapore. The exhibition and conference took place at the Sands Expo and Convention Centre and is one of their largest events ever, covering over 120,000 square meters of space in the heart of downtown Singapore. “
“We chose the Marina Bay Sands as our venue because the convention centre has a great range of facilities and is in close proximity to a host of leisure amenities. This gave delegates the wonderful opportunity to recharge, network, and experience elements of the local culture.”

	
	
	

	
	A proven track record: Singapore has hosted a successful Sibos before
	
	“Sibos returned to Singapore in 2015 for the first time since 2003, with the city celebrating its 50th year of independence – 50 years of business, innovation and success! The Singaporean community showed exceptional support for our return, and we are pleased to have run a number of initiatives which included the local community. We partnered with the Business Times Budding Artists Fund (BT BAF) to present the Art Walk for Sibos 2015 Singapore. The Art Walk showcased 20 original, specially-commissioned pieces across the convention centre, including paintings and sculptures. The artworks were conceptualised and created by local young artists, aged between 10 and 12 and sponsored by the BT BAF. We were delighted to be able to provide a platform for them to showcase their talent.”

	
	
	

	
	Local logistics and connectivity to the rest of the world
	
	“Singapore offers fantastic infrastructure, which allows us to make the most of our event.”
“It is a springboard to Asia, with excellent connectivity to other Asian countries. But it is also well connected to the rest of the world through Changi Airport – an international aviation hub, serving over 100 international airlines. This is of course vital when you consider that our delegates come from all corners of the globe!”
“The local transport system is also amongst the best in the world. The Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system is renowned for being one of the cleanest and most efficient transport systems in the world. This helps delegates to explore various places of interest within Singapore, allowing them to add to their experience.”
