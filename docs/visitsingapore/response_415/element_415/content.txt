Nathan

            Singaporean singer-songwriter
            In 2016, Nathan captured the hearts of millions of music fans, when he clinched the title of runner-up at Chinese reality talent show, ‘Sing! China’. But the charismatic singer is no newcomer to the world of music: he cut his debut album at the young age of 15, and has been on the Singapore music circuit since.
With his soulful voice, sociable personality and guy-next-door charm, he has won the hearts of fans on stages across our island. Among his first few concerts were sold-out shows at Mosaic Music Festival, held at the Esplanade–Theatres on the Bay. This still-rising star has begun to flex his many talents, having already ventured into musicals and acting—he most recently performed as one of the lead musical cast on The Great Wall: One Woman's Journey, he can also be seen on HBO’s Halfworlds.


            
        
    








    
        
            
                Connecting people through music

            
            
                “When we see our peers playing music and doing big gigs, it drives everyone to raise the bar,” Nathan shares, of Singapore’s tight knit music community. The Lion City’s myriad of opportunities to perform—and the growing wellspring of fan support for local performers—inspires the young star to keep connecting people through music. “I first started out when the general belief was that nothing good would come out of the local arts scene. It broke my heart at the time, but I never once believed that. Today, we have local artists constantly selling out shows and achieving #1 spots on the charts.”

harmonious 
 hangouts

            
            
                He’s all about spontaneity—from jam sessions at Haji Lane to the island’s best live music stages, explore a harmonised Singapore through this people-connector.

                
            
        
    







    
        
            
            
            
            
            
            
        
        
            
            Singing in the lane
            Haji Lane is one of Nathan’s favourite neighbourhoods. “I've seen bands play music on the streets there, and strangers coming to sing and dance together."

            
                
            
            
        
    










    
        
            
            
            
            
            
            
        
        
            
            Hungry fans, homegrown talent
            “The audience is hungrier than ever for music and arts that come from people we share the same streets with,” Nathan shares. “It gets me so excited for the future.” Esplanade's Mosaic Music Series showcases local musicians from a diverse array of genres, and is proof of Nathan’s hope.

            
                
            
            
        
    










    
        
            
            
            
            
            
            
        
        
            
            Unwinding with friends
            In between performances, Nathan enjoys unwinding at Holland Village with friends and family. “Holland Village holds a special place in my heart—I used to go there to hang out with friends and grab a meal.” Visit live music bar Wala Wala in the evening to catch local bands rocking the stage.

            
                
            
            
        
    










    
        
            
            
            
            
            
            
        
        
            
            Discovering new acts
            As a staunch supporter of his fellow performers, Nathan enjoys attending the dozens of local music festivals held across Singapore annually. “*SCAPE Invasion Tour, Shine Festival and St. Jerome’s Laneway Music Festival are all amazing festivals that champion local and international indie music.”
