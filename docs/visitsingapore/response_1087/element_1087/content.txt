Historic architecture, cultural diversity, and cult-status eateries are just some of the lesser-known draws that Singapore’s bustling Geylang district has to offer.
Take a stroll through the meandering lanes and bustling back alleys of this unique enclave, and you’ll find a buzzing hub filled with colourful shophouses, mosques, temples, bars and more that put Geylang firmly on the must-visit tourist trail.

                    With a rich history steeped in multicultural migration, the Geylang of today is a melting pot of ethnicities and religions. Unlike the rest of the island, it remains largely untouched by urban redevelopment; if you’re looking for a slice of old-school authentic Singapore charm, you’ll likely find it here. And we say it’s high time to delve into this unique neighbourhood through a series of brilliant immersive local tours.
During the four-hour Betel Box's Sins & Salvation: A Geylang Food Walk, a loquacious guide will not only shed light on the area’s diverse history, new migrant communities, religions and after-hours activities, but will also encourage you to eat your way around the district. Highlighting the juxtaposition that defines Geylang, you’ll find yourself passing massage parlours one moment, and beautiful temples the next.

                    Also famed for its durian shops, a trip to Geylang wouldn’t be complete without a taste of the pungent king of fruit itself—an experience that Karni Tomer of Wok ‘n’ Stroll claims to be the “ultimate foodie courage test”. Try it for yourself during her Beguiling Geylang food tour through authentic hawker centres and illuminated night markets.
This three-hour night crawl will expose you to other local delicacies including dim sum (bite-sized portions of food served in steamer baskets or small plates), turtle soup, black herbal tea, and more. Brace yourself, and your tastebuds!
