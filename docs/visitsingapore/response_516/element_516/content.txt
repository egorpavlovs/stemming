	    Last Mile Fulfilment Asia 2016 gains traction in its 2nd edition
	




	
	    
	        
                
                
	            
	            
	        
    








	
	
	
	The Last Mile Fulfilment Asia (LMFAsia) Conference & Exhibition was held from 3 to 4 March 2016 at Singapore EXPO. It is the only Asian business platform that brings together the retail, eCommerce, logistics and parcel industries to discuss business opportunities, forge strategic partnerships, learn from thought leaders and exchange market intelligence.
Into its second year, the event attracted more than 4,000 international attendees, including 500 conference delegates from over 30 countries and over 90 exhibitors from across the entire fulfilment ecosystem, representing a three-fold increase from 2015’s figures. Some of the  attendees this year include DHL, Newell Rubbermaid, and the Ascend Group from Thailand, among others.
With Southeast Asia eCommerce markets expected to be worth US$34.5 billion come 2018, the need for comprehensive eCommerce fulfilment solutions has become even more imperative in enabling eCommerce companies to aid seamless cross border fulfilment and maximise the markets’ full potential.
“The significant increase in participation by industry players in Asia Pacific and globally corresponds to the growing eCommerce market in Asia. The Asia eCommerce market grew by 36 percent in 2014 and is now twice the size of the online retail market in the United States. Inevitably, there is great interest from the industry to congregate, discuss and find solutions to the challenges arising from the last mile fulfilment aspect of the supply value chain,” said Mr. Adrian Sng, Director (Projects Management), SingEx Exhibitions.

	
	
	

	
	New Sessions Introduced
	
	Themed “eCommerce Beyond Borders”, the conference this year featured a strong line up of over 70 international speakers across four industries (Retail, eCommerce, Logistics, and Parcel) to address key themes through keynotes, panel discussions, forums/roundtables and focused tracks.
This year, LMFAsia partnered with IRCE (Internet Retailer Conference and Exhibition), the organiser of the world’s largest eCommerce show, for a one-day track and joint keynote session on 4 March. The track featured some of the leading online retailers and eCommerce entrepreneurs who are driving new marketing strategies for their business in the digital age.
The conference also presented new sessions focused on Asian government policies, cold chain logistics, case studies of retailers and fulfilment centers as well as addressed the unique needs of the perishables players and fulfilment to new markets such as Europe, Australia and North America.
LMFAsia also offered exclusive visits for delegates to visit the DHL Innovation Centre offering insights and a back-of-house tour.  A one-of-a-kind facility in Asia Pacific, the DHL Innovation Centre is designed as a platform for collaborative innovation and development of solutions that will transform the logistics and supply chain industry.
The next installment of Last Mile Fulfilment Asia (#LMFASIA) returns to Singapore in June 2018. For more information, please visit www.lmfasia.com.
