	    Overview
	






	    Sophisticated demand for Advanced Manufacturing solutions
	




	
	
	Over the last decade, Southeast Asia has been growing its manufacturing output steadily, registering a strong compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.5% and accounting for almost a 4% share of the global manufacturing output*. 
	Importantly, the region is shifting towards more productive manufacturing that require more complex skills and advanced technologies, a move reflective of the experience of other Asian manufacturing powerhouses such as Japan, South Korea and China previously. This development towards advanced manufacturing holds great potential for synergistic partnerships with EU enterprises to tap the growing Asian demand in the advanced manufacturing industry.

	
	
	




	
	
	An Advanced Manufacturing Hub
	Singapore is a globally competitive manufacturing hub supported by its strategic location offering easy accessibility to regional and international markets, as well as a pro-business environment and highly skilled workforce. The government works closely with the industry to capture opportunities from new business models, creating and enabling infrastructure and propelling talent development. Sectors such as aerospace, oil and gas, automotive and machinery have located key remanufacturing activities in Singapore, with aerospace maintenance, repair and overhaul being the biggest contributor. In fact, manufacturing accounts for about a fifth of Singapore's GDP and more than 400,000 jobs1. In the latest Committee of Future Economy Report 2017, Advanced Manufacturing is one of the key growth sectors identified for further development. This will be done by growing complementary sectors such as robotics, additive manufacturing, advanced materials, sensors and lasers and optics.

	
	
	

	
	
	Initiatives in Developing Advanced Manufacturing
	Manufacturing is a key pillar to Singapore’s economy and the government is committed to ensure the sector is well-positioned by taking measures such as investing in advanced manufacturing technologies and promoting their adoption, such as additive manufacturing and robotics. The Singapore government intends to support the Future of Manufacturing initiative and has established the Advanced Remanufacturing and Technology Centre (ARTC) in 20152. ARTC is Asia’s first centre for test-bedding and developing manufacturing technologies. It involves universities and industry partners that seek to bridge technological gaps in the adoption of advanced remanufacturing processes.

	
	
	






	    Advanced Manufacturing Business Events: Opportunities for growth
	




	
	
	Current business events landscape
	Singapore aims to become a global hub for leading advanced manufacturing business events while collaborating with more international brands in the industry. Currently, the manufacturing events in Singapore include Inside 3D Printing Singapore and Singapore International Robotics Expo. Inside 3D Printing Singapore is by the organisers of the largest professional 3D printing event worldwide, Inside 3D Printing Conference and Expo in New York., while Singapore International Robotics Expo is the regional marketplace to discover business opportunities, projects and funding availabilities for the adoption of robotics and automation solutions.

	
	
	

	
	
	Opportunities
	Singapore’s vision for a technology-intensive digital manufacturing hub opens up a new realm of business event opportunities. In particular, there are opportunities for thought-leadership platforms and marketplaces that showcase the latest emerging technologies enabling the shift to advanced manufacturing. These include events rooted in key verticals like digital factory, urban digitalisation, industrial robotics, automation, the Internet of Things, big data analysis and augmented reality.

	
	
	

	
	Did you know?
	
	
From 2014 to 2018, the Singapore government has invested some S$500 million to support the Future of Manufacturing initiative3.
It is estimated that the worldwide stock of operational industrial robots will increase from about 1,828,000 units at the end of 2016 to 3,053,000 units at the end of 2020, representing an average annual growth rate of 14 per cent between 2018 and 20204.
The National Robotics Programme is a S$450 million5 initiative to support public-private partnerships among research performers, companies and public agencies to drive R&D, test-bedding and deployment of robotics technology.
