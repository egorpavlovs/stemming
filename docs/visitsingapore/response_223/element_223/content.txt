	A luxury landmark set in the heart of a historic precinct, InterContinental® Singapore has been a Forbes Travel Guide-rated hotel since 2013. The 403-guestroom hotel is deeply rooted in the heritage of the arts and cultural districts of Bugis and Bras Basah; the hotel décor encompasses an elegant blend of modern touches with Peranakan undertones representative of colourful shophouses, once home to a multi-ethnic community of settlers known as Bugis from Indonesia.
InterContinental® Singapore is one of Singapore's most preferred venues for corporate or social events. With state-of-the-art facilities and elegantly-appointed spaces with natural daylight, the hotel is one of the top choices for meeting planners.  The hotel features over 1,000 square metres of conference and function space, with a range of fully-equipped rooms to accommodate up to 500 guests.
With direct connection to Bugis Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) station, guests also enjoy convenient access to public transportation options. The hotel is located 20 minutes from Changi International Airport and 5 minutes by car from Orchard Road and the Central Business District including Marina Bay Downtown area.
