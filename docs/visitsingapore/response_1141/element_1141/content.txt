		Before it was known as Sentosa, this island just off Singapore’s southern coast was a British military fortress. After the Japanese Occupation in World War II, Singapore returned to British rule, and the island was renamed “Sentosa” which translates to “peace and tranquility.”
Over the course of its remarkable history, Sentosa has transformed into a beloved island resort, best known for its tropical beaches, luxurious hotels and thrilling attractions. Whether you’re looking for an adrenaline rush or a day of bold exploration, a world of adventure awaits you at Sentosa.

		Avid explorers looking to discover the island’s varied charms and natural landscapes will be able to choose from a range of inspiring activities.
To get your bearings, take reference from three beaches that span Sentosa’s coastline. Each beach holds its own unique charm: Siloso Beach is the island’s most bustling stretch, and home to various restaurants and attractions; Palawan Beach’s playgrounds, parks and lagoon are perfect for families, and Tanjong Beach is ideal for a tranquil getaway.
