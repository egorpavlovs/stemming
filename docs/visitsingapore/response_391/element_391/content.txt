		Streets, galleries and museums all across Singapore come alive with spectacular art and scintillating insights during Singapore Art Week. An annual event that occurs in January, this week-long festival brings together cultural connoisseurs, creative aficionados, artists and enthusiasts alike from Singapore and across the globe.
Attending art lovers will be able to expand the boundaries of their imagination at a range of exhibitions, art fairs and after-parties. The line-up evolves every year, with bold new collaborations and showcases.
Singapore Art Week 2019’s highlights included Minimalism: Space. Light. Object.—the first-ever exhibition on Minimalism to be held in Southeast Asia—and Unhomed Belongings, a collaboration between multi-hyphenate talent Lucy Liu and local artist Shubigi Rao. The inaugural boutique art fair S.E.A. Focus shone the spotlight on modern Southeast Asian art, while the ARTery Pop-up by Art Outreach showcased collections from galleries that spanned the globe from Israel to Russia.
Besides being a multi-sensory feast, Singapore Art Week 2019 was a platform for the meeting of the art world’s most influential minds. Moderated by Mr Russell Storer of National Gallery Singapore, the Frieze Academy Series centred on the roles of public and private museums, and the future of art in Southeast Asia.
Discover intriguing possibilities, bold perspectives and newfound inspiration in the Lion City when the festival returns in 2020.

                Did you know?
                Home to the world’s largest display of modern Southeast Asian art, National Gallery Singapore is a work of art in itself. The institution inhabits Singapore’s Former Supreme Court and City Hall, grand old buildings that date back to the early 20th century.

                                Inspiration after dusk
                                Singapore Art Week 2019 saw the city come to life with a shimmering line-up of nocturnal, art-themed events. Light to Night Festival 2019: Traces and Echoes illuminated the city’s Civic District with a tapestry of urban art, light shows and multisensory walking trails, while Art After Dark at Gillman offered a range of live music performances, contemporary art showcases and F&B pop-ups.

                            
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        
                        
                            
                                
                                    
                                
                            
                            
                                A constellation of stellar showcases
                                From surreal works of art to visual gems from around Southeast Asia, Singapore Art Week 2019’s line-up of exhibitions and fairs thrilled, tantalised and inspired. Exhibitions included IMPART Collectors' Show: Fabulous Monsters, and the inaugural editions of ARTery Pop-up by Art Outreach and S.E.A. Focus. The latter included a performance art piece titled WUD YA DO IT, by Yeo Kaa, which channelled the emotion of anger into a bold form of artistic expression.

                            
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        
                        
                            
                                
                                    
                                
                            
                            
                                Art and culture intertwine in Little India
                                Art spilled over from galleries into backstreets and street corners, surprising visitors to ARTWALK Little India. Set in one of Singapore’s most colourful cultural precincts, the walk blended old with new, noise with music and scents with visual spectacle. Murals and sculptures by artists like ZERO, SONG and Shah Rizzal merged with age-old temples and bustling streets. The event also featured a range of activities for visitors, from yoga sessions and live music to movie screenings, plays and art workshops.
