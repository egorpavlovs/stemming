                            Visa & customs
                            Most visitors to Singapore do not require a visa for entry. For more information on visa requirements and the Visa Free Transit Facility, you can check with the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority or the Singapore Overseas Mission closest to you. The period of stay granted will be shown on the visit pass endorsement in your passport.
For a smooth arrival experience, do view this video to learn about the immigration process.
Upon departure, you may use the enhanced Immigration Automated Clearance System (eIACS), which offers you express self-clearance immigration. Do view this video to learn about this process.
For your convenience, download the Singapore Customs mobile app, Customs@SG, which allows you to declare and pay the duty and/or Goods and Services Tax (GST) for your overseas purchases on the go, before arriving at the checkpoint in Singapore. Find out more on declarations and payment at Singapore Customs.

                    Driving into Singapore from West Malaysia is a relaxing and scenic way of getting here. Singapore has two land checkpoints, at Tuas in the west and Woodlands in the north, that operate 24 hours a day.
                    Motorists of foreign-registered vehicles are required to have valid Autopass cards and motor insurance for their vehicles.
