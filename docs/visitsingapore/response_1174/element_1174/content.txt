                Overview

                Bar hop and discover where to drink in Singapore with this list of Ann Siang Hill and Club Street watering holes.
Between historic Chinatown and modern Telok Ayer lies an L-shaped enclave that’s known for its hip little watering holes and laid-back hangouts.
The Club Street and Ann Siang Hill district houses several cool joints worth checking out if you’re in the mood for a drink or two. Plus, since the area isn’t massive, it’s perfect for bar-hopping. Ready your beer goggles and wine glasses.



                
                
                
                 All venues are near the Chinatown and Telok Ayer MRT stations

                    First up on Club Street: 1 IZY. This Japanese izakaya-inspired (Japanese gastropub) eating spot serves up excellent chicken karaage (fried chicken) and a luxurious wagyu donburi (rice bowl), so tuck into these delights before heading into the secret bar at the back of the restaurant (the large mirror is actually a door), CACHÉ, for a tightly curated selection of drinks including ginger martini.
For those who don’t want to blow their budget, there’s 2 Drinks and Co, which operates two outlets on Club Street (one of them has a more extensive menu as well as more seating areas). Its wine, spirits and beers for the taking here, and they’re all more than reasonably priced (you can get a good bottle of wine for as low as S$35). Drop by the bottle shop if you want to pick up alcohol along the way.
If you fancy a satisfying French dinner, drop by 3 Les Buchons. Big eaters can opt for this acclaimed establishment’s 250gm ribeye steak, which is seared to perfection, while sharing plates here include gigantic a côte de bœuf platter. Les Bouchons’ seafood dishes, such as jumbo prawns and salmon fillet, are very popular too.

                    Pop into modern British restaurant 4 Oxwell and Co for dinner and head down the flight of stairs to 5 Operation Dagger—the secret underground cocktail bar that serves up experimental mixes. Can’t decide on what you want? Go for their omakase (a type of meal consisting of dishes chosen by the chef) set, which features six different cocktails and accompanying bar bites.
Vino lovers won’t be disappointed with the selection of reds and whites at 6 Beaujolais. Order some French dishes (like quiche) to go with your glass of wine.
Movie buffs, head to 7 The Screening Room for a unique combination of movies and booze. Catch classic flicks on the big screen on the third level before moving up to the fourth floor for drinks (and stunning views of the city) at the La Terraza Rooftop Bar.
If you love crowds and buzz, hit up 8 Gem Bar. You can’t miss the watering hole at the intersection of Ann Siang Hill and Club Street where hordes of people usually spill out onto the streets right outside the bar.
