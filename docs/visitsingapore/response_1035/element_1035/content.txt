These are located along heritage-rich Joo Chiat Complex, Joo Chiat Place, Haig Road and Ceylon Road. The area is a hotbed of Peranakan* culture, with traditional shophouses and hip boutiques to shop at. The tour is led by Betel Box, which also runs a hostel in the area–don’t be shy about asking them for some insider travel tips!
*The term is an Indonesian/Malay word that means “local born”, which generally refers to people of Chinese and Malay/Indonesian heritage.
