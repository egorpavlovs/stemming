                            Gravel roads, lush forests and abundant wildlife–Pulau Ubin is a living showcase of what Singapore was like in the 1960s.

                                        To get to this island sanctuary, take a bumboat from Changi Point Ferry Terminal, which will bring you to the Pulau Ubin jetty. The ride costs S$3, and takes roughly ten minutes.

                                        Besides its natural charms, the island of Pulau Ubin is home to old-school kampong (village) houses, providing visitors with a window to Singapore’s yesteryears.

		Home to verdant nature, diverse habitats and Singapore’s last real kampong (‘village’ in Malay), Pulau Ubin provides visitors with a window into The Lion City’s past.
	


        Unspoilt, rustic charm

		Still, the charms of the island will captivate you, as it remains largely authentic, unspoilt and rustic, right down to the occasional whiffs of wildlife.
With an area of 10.2 square kilometres, this boomerang-shaped 1,020-hectare island sits just off the northeastern corner of mainland Singapore, in the Straits of Johor.
See if you can spot the abandoned quarries on Pulau Ubin, which means Granite Island in Malay.
	


        Wildlife encounters

		
        

		
        

		
        

		
		Today, instead of miners, you’re more likely to bump into mynahs as well as other wildlife.
Nature lovers flock here on weekends as Pulau Ubin supports a rich ecosystem teeming with flora and fauna as well as threatened species of birds.
The island's star attraction is the Chek Jawa Wetlands. The intertidal flat comprises coral reefs, which are home to extensive marine wildlife, such as sea hares, sea squirts, octopuses, starfish, sand dollars, sponges and cuttlefish.
Be warned that you could get used to the slow pace of life here–it’s too easy to leave your worries behind.
Getting to Pulau Ubin is easy–just a 10-minute bumboat ride from Changi Point Ferry Terminal.

                Did you know?
                According to myth, a frog, a pig and an elephant challenged each other to race to Johor. The losers would turn to stone. All three didn’t make it. The elephant and pig turned into Pulau Ubin. The frog became Pulau Sekudu or Frog Island.

                                	Bike or hike, you decide
                                
                                
                                	The best way to experience and discover the treasures on this island is either on a rented bicycle or by taking a leisurely trail walk (one excellent guide is the Pulau Ubin Tree Trail). 
                                
                            
                            
                        

                        
                        
                            
                            
                                
                                	Up close in Chek Jawa Wetlands
                                
                                
                                	Consider booking a guided tour in advance. Or, if you prefer, stroll on the boardwalk that cuts through the mangrove for a closer look of the plant and marine life.
