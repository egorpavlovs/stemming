	    Overview
	






	    The future of Design is in Asia
	




	
	
	Singapore is firmly establishing its credentials as the design capital of Asia, further burnishing its UNESCO Creative City of Design standing.
	Boundless market potential and vast regional talent pools have seen the international design scene shift its focus away from the mature West to the emerging East.
This new energy has seen Singapore’s prominence increase further, as both a gateway to Asia for international design houses, as well as a gateway to international markets for new Asian designers.

	
	
	




	
	
	Market and consumer sophistication
	From architecture and interiors to fashion and retail, Singapore’s refined consumer base sustains high demand for the world’s top names in design. A UNESCO Creative City of Design since 2015, Singapore is also shaping up to be a key design hub spearheading regional industry development, as global labels launch into the booming Asia Pacific market from the flourishing city-state.
Multi-national corporations recognise Singapore’s unique confluence of arts, culture, business, and technology and are responding by establishing new design centres here to tailor exclusive products for Asian markets. Among them are Procter & Gamble, Electrolux, Porsche Design Studio and Tupperware Brands. 
Award-winning international architects are coming to Singapore for collaborations and developing new architectural projects such as Learning Hub by Thomas Heatherwick, The Interlace and DUO by Ole Scheeren, and the upcoming Project Jewel Changi Airport by Moshe Safdie, who was also behind the iconic Marina Bay Sands® integrated resort.

	
	
	

	
	
	Talented network of designers
	Singapore’s home-grown designers are greatly valued and have also gained global acclaim, winning a slew of prestigious international awards. Some local initiatives that showed recognition and support towards design excellence are the Singapore Good Design Mark (SG Mark) and the President’s Design Award. 
Little wonder Singapore’s calendar of design events is filling up fast, with internationally-renowned events coming to Singapore, providing an unmatched platform for fashion, architecture and interior design brands to showcase their wares to Asia and global key buyers. 
Dedicating support to this growing industry, the DesignSingapore Council has launched a Design Masterplan to take Singapore to 2025, aiming to infuse design into everyone’s skillset in order to turn Singapore into a high-value, thriving and innovation-driven economy.

	
	
	






	    Design Business Events: Opportunities for growth
	




	
	
	Current business events landscape
	Today, Singapore regularly hosts thought leadership trade conferences that span across various design-related industries, as well as solutions-driven trade exhibitions. Held in March, the Singapore Design Week sets the stage for Asian design talents, bringing together events such as the International Furniture Fair Singapore, Brainstorm Design, SingaPlural, and awards programmes like the Singapore Good Design Mark and Singapore Design Awards. In September, Archifest celebrates architecture and the built environment, and facilitates the exchange of international and local architectural design, practice and education. The Singapore Fashion Week in October is the only fashion week in the world that features established and emerging regional and home grown designers and labels alongside the world’s most iconic international designers.

	
	
	

	
	
	Opportunities
	Given the evolving needs of different verticals within the design industry, business events in the areas of design thinking, architecture and applications of technology to the fashion industry are rising in demand. In today’s ideas-driven economy, design thinking is increasingly applied across all industries to create new value. Hence, design-thinking conferences that span business and lifestyle are expected to command a keen audience. The recent years also saw international architectural firms setting up shop in Asia to tap the rising demand of the markets. Several projects are already winning international awards and accolades, forming the perfect backdrop for thought-leading architecture dialogues and trade conferences. For the fashion industry, technological advancements and a highly competitive retail business environment are shaping up to be key factors that impact consumer behaviour. Hence, fashion and technology-focused events that drive industry innovation are also particularly relevant to the industry.
