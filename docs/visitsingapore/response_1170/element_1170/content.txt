		A visit to Marina Bay is guaranteed to bombard your senses. With land reclamation works starting only in the 1970s, the transformation of the area has been nothing short of a miracle. 
	


        Architectural masterpieces 

		
        

		
        

		
        

		
		Marvel at the collection of architectural icons that dot the impressive skyline, or brag about having seen some of the best views in the world from Sands SkyPark® at Marina Bay Sands®, designed by no less than the renowned architect Moshe Safdie.
Want a nature fix? Pop over to the 101-hectare Gardens by the Bay. Revel in the spectacular views from the Supertree Grove amid lush gardens. Escape from the tropical heat at the cooled conservatories or let the kids splash about at the Children’s Garden Water Play area.
Dizzy by the sights of a nautical vision in the distance? That’s just the Marina Bay Cruise Centre Singapore designed to receive the newer generation of larger cruise liners.
	


        New city living

		
        

		
        

		
        

		
		Expect to see power suits and briefcases while joggers pound the pavement and cyclists whiz by alfresco cafes. You are as likely to find people who come here to work as people who call Marina Bay their home.
If you’re feeling cowed by the skyscrapers, walk along the scenic waterfront promenade decorated with artistic sculptures that lead you right to the water’s edge of Marina Reservoir, where you’ll probably come across kite flyers, dragon boat races, even musical performances.
And this is all just another ordinary day at Marina Bay.

                Did you know?
                Beat the heat while strolling the 3.5km waterfront promenade around Marina Bay. Just look out for the three breeze shelters lined along the way. Large solar-powered fans make these pavilions a comfy resting spot.
Often perceived as having a futuristic design that evokes a spaceship, Marina Bay Sands’ three iconic towers were designed to resemble a deck of cards. The Infinity Pool perched on the building’s pinnacle is three times the length of an Olympic swimming pool.
While you may be standing on dry land while visiting Marina Bay in the present, the district is just one of many areas created by Singapore’s extensive land reclamation efforts. Over the last two centuries, Singapore’s land area has expanded by a whopping 25 percent.
