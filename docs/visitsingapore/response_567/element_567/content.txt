	    Experience Creation in the Tourism Industry
	




	
	
	
	Against the context of increasing capacity constraints and attracting more discerning travellers, improving tourism software through experiences is becoming more important as a differentiating factor. This is especially pertinent as business and leisure travellers today are seeking more innovative, immersive and experiential platforms that would allow them to connect emotionally with the destination. Through experiences like tours, interactive programmes and personalised services, tourism businesses can provide additional value to visitors and thereby attract greater spend and repeat visitorship.
To up skill businesses in experience creation, the Singapore Tourism Board has created two videos to remind the industry about the importance of experience creation to catalyse support in enhancing the existing tourism experiences and in developing new immersive experiences to drive quality tourism.

	
	
	




	
	                        
	                        
	                    
	Understanding What Visitors Seek
	
	Targeting personnel within the tourism industry who are actively involved in creating visitor experiences, the first video delves on how industry partners can augment authenticity and create value in their offerings to create memorable experiences.

	
	
	




	
	                        
	                        
	                    
	Staging a Visitor’s Experience Journey
	
	Targeting personnel within the tourism industry who are actively involved in creating visitor experiences, the second video looks at how industry partners can leverage touch points throughout the visitor’s experience journey (namely the pre-experience, actual experience and post-experience stage) to create memorable moments.
