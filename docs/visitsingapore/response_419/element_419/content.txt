                                        The famous 328 Katong Laksa has been a neighbourhood favourite for decades. No chopsticks are required for this hearty noodle dish; you can slurp up all that flavour with just a spoon.

            Where old-school meets new-school
            
            
                        
                            
                            1 328 Katong Laksa
                            Made with a recipe passed down from generations, this stall’s laksa (spicy coconut milk-based noodle soup) is a hot favourite (pun intended) in the neighbourhood, and has won a Michelin Bib Gourmand recommendation. Lovers of all things spicy should certainly try this Peranakan*-inspired rendition of a locally beloved dish.
*The term is an Indonesian/Malay word that means “local born”, which generally refers to people of Chinese and Malay/Indonesian heritage.

                        
                    
                        
                            
                            2 Baba Chews
                            An innovative taste on traditional nonya staples, Baba Chews' allure comes from its Western-inspired take on Peranakan delicacies, such as its ayam buah keluak (chicken accompanied by a black nut indigenous to Southeast Asia) burger and its iberico pork ribs pongteh (nonya braised pork with fermented soy bean sauce). Foodies looking to expand their definition of fusion cuisine and taste the best of both east and west should make a pit stop here for dinner.
                        
                    
                        
                            
                            3 Birds of Paradise
                            A well-loved dessert store with contemporary and botanical-inspired flavours, Birds of Paradise serves up a range of innovative gelatos that incorporate the flavour profiles of herbs, fruits and flowers. Vanilla will certainly seem bland in comparison to flavours like white chrysanthemum and strawberry basil.
