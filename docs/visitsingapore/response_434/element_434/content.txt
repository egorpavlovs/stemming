		Prepaid SIM card
If you wish to continue making calls and sending messages on your mobile phone, a good option will be to purchase a Singapore prepaid SIM card. All three local telcos - M1, Singtel and Starhub - offer a wide variety of packages, so take a little time to decide which plan best suits your needs. You can choose from bundles for local and international calls and SMSes and select varying amounts of local mobile data. Durations typically range from five to thirty or more days.

Prepaid SIM cards are easily purchased at the telcos’ retail counters and convenience stores like 7-Eleven and Cheers through the island, as well as at Singapore Changi Airport at Changi Recommends, currency exchange and telcos’ retail counters. You will have to produce your passport for registration when purchasing a prepaid SIM card.
	

















        

		
        

		
        
			
                
                
                  
			
		

		
        

		
		Pocket Wi-Fi
You can also choose to connect to the Internet from multiple devices with a pocket Wi-Fi device. This is simply a mobile hotspot that provides data access via the cellphone network for your laptop, tablet and/or smartphone wherever you go in Singapore.
This is recommended if you carry a few devices, desire Wi-Fi connectivity and do not intend to make many phone calls. Pocket Wi-Fi devices are available for rental at the Changi Recommends counters at the Singapore Changi Airport, and you can conveniently drop off the devices at the Changi Recommends counters just before your return flight. There are other pocket Wi-Fi rental companies available in Singapore, and if you prefer to search and pre-register online, these companies offer easy delivery and return of the pocket Wi-Fi device to and from your hotel.

		Wireless@SG
This is a free public Wi-Fi service across Singapore, with hotspots available at many locations, including malls, museums, public libraries, community centres, MRT stations, Changi Airport and Sentosa island. An updated list of hotspot coverage is available here. You can also look out for the Wireless@SG decal on display wherever this network is available, as well as the SSID Wireless@SG on your device. To get connected, register for an account with your foreign mobile number at any Wireless@SG hotspot and you will receive your login details via an SMS message. Overseas charges may apply.

		2G Networks
From 1 April 2017, all three telcos in Singapore – M1, Singtel and Starhub – will cease the provision of the 2G network in Singapore. Visitors are advised to bring along a 3G or 4G enabled mobile device when visiting Singapore. If your existing operator does not support 3G or 4G roaming, you can purchase a prepaid SIM card on arrival so you can be instantly connected.
