	3 ways Singapore models green city living
	
	Home to over 5.5 million, Singapore has implemented a sophisticated catalog of urban solutions that have secured the city-state a top 10 ranking on ARCADIS' most sustainable cities list.

	City in the Garden
	
	Since the start of the country’s journey to be a garden city in 1963, Singapore has come a long way to become the world-class City in a Garden that it is today. Last year, there was much fanfare when the Singapore Botanic Gardens was officially designated a UNESCO World Heritage site, even as the Gardens started work on a new extension. Besides an expanded Botanic Gardens, residents and visitors alike can look forward to new parks in the heartlands and a revitalised Green Corridor, as part of Singapore’s evolving City in the Garden vision.

	How Singapore is a city built for a new generation of urbanites
	
	One of the greatest global challenges for economists, social scientists, city planners, environmentalists, and governments is the burgeoning population boom in cities. Africa, Asia, Southeast Asia, and India in particular are expected to see massive urban population growth in the not too distant future: a UN report estimated that by 2050, two-thirds of the world’s population will live in cities, with 90% of the growth occurring in African and Asian countries. While the shift is already bringing environmental, economic, and cultural benefits, it also poses a major threat to the infrastructure of cities—which are already strained in many places as it is—and will place excessive demand on limited natural resources. Worst-case scenarios could include grave problems like housing shortages, air pollution, and traffic congestion.
