		The bustling streets of Singapore roar to life each year with the Grand Prix Season Singapore in September. The highlight is of course the FORMULA 1 SINGAPORE AIRLINES SINGAPORE GRAND PRIX, which puts the world’s top racers to the test through the challenging circuit right in the heart of The Lion City.
The Grand Prix Season Singapore 2018 saw nail-biting on-track action with Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton securing pole position and leading commandingly on race day all the way to the chequered flag ahead of Red Bull’s Max Verstappen and Sebastian Vettel of Ferrari.
Besides the drama, tension and spectacle on track, there was a whole slew of exciting off-track activities that visitors enjoyed. GPSS 2018 featured exclusive VIP parties, virtual reality race-themed games and live music festivals, alongside dining and other entertainment options.
Some of the world’s most beloved bands and musicians rocked the stages of the Circuit Park, across three days. Among them were Grammy-winning rock band The Killers, chart-topping pop idol Dua Lipa, Asian sensation Jay Chou and Liam Gallagher of the legendary Oasis.

            THE BEST OF GRAND PRIX SEASON SINGAPORE 2018
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                        
                            
                                
                                    
                                
                            
                            
                                TAG Heuer cooks up a storm
                                Swiss luxury watch brand TAG Heuer brought the heat to Orchard Road, with a cook-off challenge between Red Bull driver Daniel Ricciardo and Joseph Schooling, Singapore’s first Olympic gold medallist.
The cook-off marked the start of a scintillating dance party, as the two renowned athletes joined Berlin-based DJ Peggy Gou at the console. The trio spun an eclectic mix of house and techno tracks that raised the roof, and got the crowd grooving to the beat.

                            
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        
                        
                            
                                
                                    
                                
                            
                            
                                Party time at The Podium Lounge
                                Race fans danced the night away at venues across the city. One of the hottest events was The Podium Lounge, which celebrated its 10th anniversary in Singapore and pulled out all stops with supermodels, royalty and celebrities such as Joel Madden, Taboo of The Black Eyed Peas, Boyzone’s Keith Duffy and Westlife’s Brian McFadden amongst the party-goers.

                            
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        
                        
                            
                                
                                    
                                
                            
                            
                                Iconic car showcase at Classics in the City
