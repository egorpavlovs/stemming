	    Asia TV Forum and Market
	




	
	
	
	Last year, the four-day Screen Singapore (SS) and Asia TV Forum & Market (ATF) kicked off on 9 December. ATF is the leading trade event for Asia’s entertainment content industry, bringing together international content sellers and Asian buyers to buy, sell, finance, distribute and co-produce content across all platforms. The event was, by all accounts, a huge hit.
Consider the numbers: Attended by 4,800 industry players and insiders, ATF 2014 attracted 846 buyers and 658 exhibitors housed in 13 pavilions. International players such as Viacom, Turner, Disney, Keshet, Twitter, BBC and National Geographic made their presence felt. Big guns in the entertainment and content industry attended: James Zhonglei Wang, President, Huayi Brothers Media Corporation gave the opening keynote speech followed by Ma Dong, chief content officer of Baidu’s iQiyi.
 

	
	
	

	
	              
	                  “The Singapore Media Festival aims to be one of Asia’s flagship media events that facilitates exchanges within the industry and shines the spotlight on Singapore and Asian content. We will continue to promote collaboration around new avenues of content creation and delivery as well as audience engagement.” - Angeline Pooh, Assistant Chief Executive Officer (Industry), Media Development Authority
	              
	          
	
	
	The Singapore Media Festival (SMF) provided global industry players looking to expand their media business in Asia a marketplace to buy and sell content. Last year’s inaugural SMF proved very fruitful. The Singapore International Film Festival (SGIFF) made a strong comeback, unveiling 147 movies from 50 countries, while its competitive arm, Silver Screen Awards, gave a total of nine prizes for emerging filmmakers. Major deals were inked at SMF, including the launch of a S$130 million (US$100 million) media fund for investments in China’s media and entertainment industry. 
By having related objectives with SMF and the other co-located events, ATF was able to achieve synergy through cross-promotion, which is beneficial to all partners in terms of reaching Asian and international media players within the industry to drive attendance to the events. Moreover, ATF/SS 2014 registered approximately US$256.28 million in sales deals, a 30% increase compared to the 2013 edition. New deals were formed between established international media players.  

	
	
	

	
	
	
	And the advantages of co-locating are immediately apparent. Like any quality event, ATF is constantly on the lookout for exciting, groundbreaking content for conference delegates. Being a part of the SMF calendar means ATF has the additional resource of leveraging the speakers and thought leaders attending the other SMF events. Attendees at ATF have benefited greatly, as they now have the opportunity to network with industry players across the entire SMF umbrella of events, rather than just within ATF. Such platforms allow for cross-industry pollination of ideas to occur, which could lead to innovative collaborations.  

	
	
	




	
	              
	                  ATF is the perfect event for all sellers and buyers. It helps you get updated with the new trending programmes. Conveniently being held in Singapore, it allows everyone from all over the world to meet strategically in Asia. - Cecilia Linawaty, Media Operation & Content Acquisition Senior, DAAI TV, Indonesia

	              
	          
	
	What to expect this year
	Projected to become even bigger this year, ATF is planning even more differentiated content for its December line-up, such as:
The ATF Pre-market conference, which brings together leaders of the industry to discuss emerging challenges and opportunities, new business models, major investments and radical innovations; the Junior@ATF Conference, which covers kids’ genres beyond animation; and the Formats@ATF Conference where industry players discuss emerging trends in formats.
