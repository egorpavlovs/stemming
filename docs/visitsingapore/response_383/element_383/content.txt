            11. Raffles in Southeast Asia: Revisiting the Scholar and Statesman 
		
            
            
    
            
            
    

            
            
                Sir Stamford Raffles—author of The History of Java, and collector of natural history and cultural materials from Southeast Asia—is known for establishing modern Singapore as a British port. He has been viewed as a scholarly expert in the region, a progressive reformer, a committed imperialist, and even a plagiariser. Co-curated with the British Museum, and keeping with the Asian Civilisations Museum’s mission to explore encounters and connections, this exhibition presents a multi-layered picture of Raffles, and illustrates that his legacy is more complex than often understood.
Date: Till 28 Apr
Venue: Asian Civilisations Museum
