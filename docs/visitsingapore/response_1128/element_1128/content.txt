Stories help us make sense of the world, and parents who’d like to encourage their children to read can get assistance from some of the literary world’s brightest stars. The Singapore Writer’s Festival is an annual affair that regularly hosts some of the world’s most prominent novelists, poets and storytellers, from Pulitzer Prize winner Junot Diaz to British poet laureate Carol Ann Duffy.
The festival’s kid’s programming branch, SWF3 (also known as Singapore’s Writer’s Festival for Families) has world-renowned and locally loved authors holding readings, educational workshops and interactive activities for tots and teens alike.

                    Rainforest Lumina
If you’re looking to walk on the wild side with your family, the Rainforest Lumina night trail at the Singapore Zoo will make for the perfect excursion. Part of the Singapore Zoo’s 45th anniversary celebrations in 2018, this interactive media walk merges a compelling narrative with an enthralling, audio-visual spectacle.
The trail itself takes place across ten interactive zones, regaling visitors with the exploits of the unlikely team of heroes known as the Creature Crew. It’s a great way to have a romp with the family while teaching your little ones about sustainability and the beauty of nature.
