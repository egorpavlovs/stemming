	Highlights of the trade show
	ITB Asia 2014 marked the launch of its first CSR Day on 29 October. This day of events and conferences sparked off discussions on economically, socially-ethical and environmentally responsible tourism. CSR Day also saw the announcement of the finalists for the new ITB-National Geographic World Legacy Awards, which honour organisations leading the way in sustainable tourism.
For the fourth year running, ITB Asia, together with Wild Asia and The Blue Yonder, hosted a series of Responsible Tourism events. Through interactive clinics and workshops, experienced tourism professionals shared their expertise on community tourism and sustainability practices. The message of sustainability was further reinforced at the Responsible Tourism Forum on the last day of ITB Asia. Speakers discussed standards of sustainable tourism, while providing practical tools and applications to achieve sustainability.
Winners of the Wild Asia Responsible Tourism Awards 2014 were announced, and like-minded delegates were given the opportunity to get together at the International Responsible Tourism Networking Event, which closed the day.

	
	
	

	
	              
	                  ITB Asia is an important platform to communicate and generate greater awareness about sustainability to key decision makers in the travel industry. Through our leadership efforts, we hope to further the conversations on sustainability and spur more companies and individuals to go green wherever possible. - Mr. Benny Zin, Chief Operating Officer and Vice President of Conventions & Exhibitions
Marina Bay Sands
	              
	          
	
	How did the show fare?
	ITB Asia 2014 was attended by 9,650 trade delegates from 108 countries around the world. The combined efforts of the Marina Bay Sands and ITB Asia teams resulted in a 34 per cent reduction of the overall carbon footprint from 399 tonnes in 2012 to 262 tonnes in 2014, surpassing the original aim of a five per cent reduction.
The total energy consumption over the three days decreased by 34.5 per cent from 2012, and 2.6 tonnes of brochures were collected and recycled at the end of the event. What’s more, the carbon footprint produced for the event was offset entirely through the investment of carbon credits into two regional climate change mitigation projects through Marina Bay Sands’ partner, Carbon Story, thus ensuring that ITB Asia 2014 would be completely carbon neutral.
