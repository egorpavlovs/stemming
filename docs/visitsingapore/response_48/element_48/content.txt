					            ITB Asia understands the importance of sustainability and its increasing influence over the travel and tourism sector. With the successful launch of our first official CSR Day as part of last year’s conference programme, ITB Asia is proud to be a leading platform for delegates to learn more about the latest trends, issues and environmentally-friendly options available. Achieving our first carbon neutral event, in collaboration with Marina Bay Sands, is a milestone in our ongoing efforts to actively promote environmental awareness.

					            Singapore is the destination of choice for the 2014 convention because we had not been to the Far East for a long time. The retail board always considers retail-focused destinations that they feel attendees may be able to learn from.

					            Singapore is a great location in which to combine work and play. The best conversations often happen outside of a formal setting, and we leveraged Singapore’s stunning range of amenities for a number of our social and networking events. The diverse culture, food and nightlife of Singapore made Sibos 2015 a memorable experience for the delegates.
