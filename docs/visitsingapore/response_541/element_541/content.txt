	    Overview
	




	
	
	
	From 17 to 19 November 2015, some 3,000 exhibitors representing more than 150 countries came together for ibtm world (formerly EIBTM) 2015 and made Barcelona the centre of the global meetings industry for three days. The Singapore Exhibition and Convention Bureau (SECB) also exhibited at the event, leading a delegation of 10 local industry partners from hotels to destination management companies to promote Singapore as a leading business events destination. 

	
	
	




	
	    
	        
                
                
	            
	            
	        
    








	
	
	
	In addition to providing networking opportunities for exhibitors, visitors, and hosted buyers from the global meetings industry, ibtm world 2015 also sought to show industry players what the future holds. New highlights included the Innovation Zone, a dedicated area showcasing selected technology products that may impact or even change the tourism and meetings industry.

	
	
	




	
	    
	        
                
                
	            
	            
	        
    








	
	
	
	Keeping up with the global industry’s adoption of technology for a more immersive experience in the meetings industry, the Singapore Pavilion also included a new 360-degree virtual reality station that gave guests and potential buyers a virtual tour of Singapore’s attractions and cityscape.  
The SECB also played up the Singapore Botanic Gardens’ recent recognition as a UNESCO World Heritage Site at the Singapore Pavilion, installing garden arches and a vertical garden made up of more than 1,500 orchids, which were well-received by the crowd. 

	
	
	




	
	    
	        
                
                
	            
	            
	        
    








	
	
	
	Ms Margaret Soh from Tour East Singapore was one of the exhibitors at the Singapore Pavilion. She shared how visitors were impressed by the pavilion’s design, “Many came to touch the real flowers; the Garden City theme was a big crowd puller! Being our national flower, these beautiful orchids can really differentiate and promote Singapore as a Garden City.”
Side events were also lined up each day to further engage visitors. For example, the SECB threw a Singapore’s 50th Birthday Party on the second day, attracting international buyers to share our national joy and pride.
 

	
	
	




	
	    
	        
                
                
	            
	            
	        
    








	
	
	
	Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, Minister for Foreign Affairs, also made a surprise visit to the Singapore Pavilion. 

	
	
	




	
	    
	        
                
                
	            
	            
	        
    








	
	
	
	All in all, the SECB and local industry partners agreed that it was a successful participation and look forward to participating again at ibtm world 2016. For more information about SECB’s participation at ibtm world, please contact: secb@stb.gov.sg
