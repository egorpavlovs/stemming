	    Forever Living Global Rally 2015
	




	
	Overview
	
	Forever Living Products (FLP), an international direct selling company dealing in wellness and beauty products, held its annual Global Rally in Singapore to celebrate the sales success of top distributors worldwide.
FLP president Gregg Maughan said: “Singapore is a beautiful and exciting tourist destination with an interesting history that parallels our company identity. Marina Bay Sands (MBS) suited our event because of its scale, luxury facilities and top-of-the-line restaurants, meeting spaces and guestrooms.”

	
	
	

	
	Programme Highlights
	
	Forever Living Global Rally was the single biggest corporate event held in MBS in five years with a group size of 7,000 people from 106 countries. It occupied the entire Level 5 of Sands Expo and more than five ballroom on Level 4. Over the three days of meetings, delegates had the opportunity to see new products, enjoy local dance and musical groups, and pick up more than US24 million in bonus awards. 
A CSR initiative called “Stop Hunger Now” also took place, where 1,000 delegates and 70 FLP executive staff and MBS team members packed over 285,000 meals as part of World Hunger Week 2015.
More than 200 top qualifiers enjoyed an Asian fusion dinner at Gardens by the Bay, while some 2,350 delegates flocked to Sentosa with ticketed access to Universal Studios Singapore™, S.E.A. Aquarium™ and other attractions. The day rounded off with games on Siloso Beach – volleyball, football and other sports – plus a barbecue, music and dancing.
Nick Woodward-Shaw, FLP director of events, said: “This was a fantastic event and it wouldn’t be nearly as amazing without our partners and staff. The Marina Bay Sands staff worked closely with our teams for a seamless experience for our qualifiers. It was wonderful to be able to have our events under one roof and have our qualifiers treated like VIPs all week.”
