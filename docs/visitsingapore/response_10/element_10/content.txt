	    Insurance
	




	
	
	a. Do I need to buy insurance for my event?
	
For the purpose of the Event, the event organiser shall at its own cost and expense maintain and/or cause to be maintained insurance policy(ies) with an insurance company duly licensed in Singapore or an international insurance company acceptable to the venue owner (aka “Licensor”). 


	
	
	

	
	
	b. What kind of insurance / how much coverage?
	
The policy(ies) must provide for:

a)  Damage to or loss of property;
b)  Comprehensive general public liability in the sum of not less than S$1,000,000.00 for each and every claim, providing coverage against claims for bodily injury, death, property damage or loss occurring in or upon or resulting from the organisation or holding of the Event, or arising out of the provision of any service by the Licensor and such other insurances that the Licensor may in its sole and absolute discretion require; and
c)  Nominate the Licensor as an insured.

The policy(ies) must include:

a)  a   provision  for   waiver    of   subrogation  against   the Licensor;
b)  a provision that  the  liability of the  insurer to  pay  under such  policy   must  not  be  affected  by  the  act,  default, omission  or negligence of any party  to such policy;
c)  the  legal liability of the  Licensee  for  loss or damage to the  Licence Area (including all fixtures and fittings in it), by the  deletion  from  the  policy  of the  relevant exclusion relating to the property in the care, custody  or control  of the Licensee or any employee of the Licensee; and
d)  a cross liability provision so that each of the Licensor and the Licensee  shall  be  considered a  separate and distinct person  and  all  references to  "insured persons" (or  such  similar term) under  the  policy  shall  be considered as applying to each of the  Licensor  and  the Licensee in the  same manner as if a separate policy  had been issued to each of them.

The Licensee must give the Licensor satisfactory documentary evidence of the policy(ies) and the receipt for the premium paid in respect of the policy(ies) at any time immediately on demand.
