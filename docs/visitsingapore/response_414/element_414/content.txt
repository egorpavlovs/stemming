Socialisers meet

            
            
                Chill out or dance the night away at bars, clubs, beach parties, outdoor concerts, and music festivals. Or enjoy a night of side-splitting laughs at stand-up comedy hangouts. Immerse in distinctive and diverse entertainment and nightlife experiences, and connect with great company. If you want to meet people with the same passions, here’s where the socialisers―clubbers, pubbers, music lovers, minglers―meet.

Nathan Hartono

            Singaporean singer-songwriter
            In 2016, Nathan Hartono captured the hearts of millions of music fans, when he clinched the title of runner-up at Chinese reality talent show, ‘Sing! China’. But the charismatic singer is no newcomer to the world of music: he cut his debut album at the young age of 15, and has been on the Singapore music circuit since. With his soulful voice, sociable personality and guy-next-door charm, he has won the hearts of fans on stages across our island. Among his first few concerts were sold-out shows at Mosaic Music Festival, held at the Esplanade–Theatres on the Bay. This still-rising star has begun to flex his many talents, having already ventured into musicals and acting—he can be seen in HBO’s Halfworlds.
