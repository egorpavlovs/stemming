	    Overview
	




	
	
	
	Newly opened The South Beach in Singapore's vibrant Civic District adds a luxurious element to Singapore's already bustling MICE sector, offering event organisers a premium space in the heart of the city.

	Designed by British architect Sir Norman Foster with interiors by French architect Philippe Starck, who is known for his quirky and whimsical designs, the 654-room development is nothing short of stunning.

	
	
	




	
	    
	        
                
                
	            
	            
						
						"The check-in desks at the hotel lobby are inspired by cultures from around the world."
						
						
					
	        
    








	
	
	
	Since its official opening on 3 September 2015, the South Beach has already hosted a diverse range of events, from weddings and annual dinners to product launches and cocktails events. Housed in a former military Drill Hall, the Grand Ballroom comes with a pre-function room, a VIP holding room, a bridal room and two courtyards flanking the main hall.

	The South Beach also features 19 state-of-the-art meeting rooms as well as a Business Centre for event organisers and delegates to conduct their conferences and workshops.

	Some 15 of the hotel's 19 meeting rooms are located in a conserved heritage building, while the remaining four can be found at the hotel's executive lounge. These rooms vary in size and can be customised according to the occasion – whether it's a private meeting, breakout session or a lunch or dinner event. The meeting rooms can also be combined to accommodate up to 72 people.
Recognising the importance of connectivity and mobility to MICE and business travellers, guests can choose to connect to the Internet both offline within the premises and online through the hotel’s Wi-Fi.
Guests looking to unwind after business hours have lots to choose from at The South Beach too. Dedicated areas known as "Imaginative Social Spaces" house gyms, sky gardens and infinity pools, allowing guests to destress in comfort.

	Meanwhile, the hotel's food and beverage establishments offer a range of culinary delights for a variety of occasions, be it a business lunch or a celebratory drink. The ADHD (All Day Hotel Dining) restaurant is located one floor below the hotel lobby. Guests can also look forward to the opening of gastro bar LAUGH, as well as PREFIX and Court Martial Bar. 

	
	
	




	
	Did you know?
	Interesting facts about The South Beach
	
The individual check-in desks at the hotel lobby are inspired by different cultures European, Peranakan, North American, South American, Indian, Chinese and Moorish – from around the world.


The Grand Ballroom – known as A La Carte after the French phrase “as per menu” – can be named after the purpose and theme of the event. Kiri and Kanan, the two courtyards flanking the Grand Ballroom, are named after commonly used military terms meaning Left and Right in Malay. This reflects the history of the ballroom, which has been conserved from the former Beach Road Camp.


The Assembly, located in a conserved heritage building, houses Court Martial Bar and 15 meeting rooms named after the NATO phonetic alphabet from Alpha to Oscar.


The Showcase Guest Rooms come complete with up to nine high-speed USB ports to provide convenience to gadget-heavy guests.
