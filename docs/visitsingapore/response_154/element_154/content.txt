	    ITB Asia, Asian Travel Trade Show 2014
	




	
	
	Overview
	Organised by Messe Berlin (Singapore), ITB Asia is an annual three-day travel trade show focusing on the Asia Pacific market. The 2014 edition took place in Sands Expo and Convention Centre, Marina Bay Sands, Singapore from 29 to 31 October 2014, and was the trade show’s first ever carbon neutral edition.
Messe Berlin (Singapore) collaborated with Marina Bay Sands to reduce ITB Asia’s carbon footprint, and to raise awareness on sustainable and responsible tourism through its inaugural Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Day and other environmentally focused initiatives and events.

	
	
	

	
	
	What green measures were taken?
	ITB Asia set the goal of reducing its carbon footprint by five per cent from 399 tonnes in 2012. To achieve that, it worked with hotel partner Marina Bay Sands to implement a range of green measures, such as choosing food items sourced regionally for the Harvest Menu, utilising newly activated in-room motion sensors to ensure maximum room lighting efficiency, and setting a room temperature of 24 degree Celcius for optimal energy usage.
Unused booth giveaways and stationery at the end of the show were collected from exhibitors and donated to Food from the Heart, while leftover brochures were collected for recycling. This donation and recycling drive is a first for both ITB Asia and Marina Bay Sands, an ISO 20121-certified venue host.
At the same time, ITB Asia ensured a comprehensive line-up of sustainability-related programmes throughout the three days to raise awareness of this important issue.
