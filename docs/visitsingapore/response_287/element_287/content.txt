	    Bidvest Conference 2014
	




	
	
	Overview
	SingExpress Travel Pte Ltd organised Bidvest Conference, a senior management conference from South Africa, which took place in Singapore in February 2014. The event, which lasted for five days was attended by 60 people in the top management team, including the board of directors. Bidvest turned out to be a successful mix of company-related activities infused with local flavours and highlights that only Singapore can offer.

	
	
	

	
	
	Programme highlights
	The programme was a great combination of business-related activities interspersed with leisure time that gave participants an authentic “Singapore” experience. The business segment consisted of two half-day meetings, with fun pre- and post-meeting group social activities.

	
	
	




	
	    
	        
                
                
	            
	            
	        
	        
                
                
	            
	            
	        
    
            
		
		
            
		








	
	
	Team-building activities
	Delegates were introduced to “Rock Band”, a hilarious and entertaining group activity. As the name suggests, this activity gave participants a chance to be part of their own rock band. They were divided into 10 teams and given lessons on how to “play” various musical instruments by musical directors. The participants had fun learning the instruments and being rockers. The finale involved each team performing in a musical show.
It was a great way for participants to let their hair down and rock out. The group also trooped to the Long Bar at Raffles Hotel, home to the iconic Singapore Sling. Participants were treated to a demo on how the Singapore Sling was made, followed by getting their hands dirty by mixing and sampling their own drinks. After which, they proceeded for dinner at Raffles Grill, where they were left impressed by the impeccable service and food as well as the elegant surroundings. On a separate day, the group had a chance to view the beauty of Singapore from the water, witnessing the changing colours of the skyline and the city lighting up as they enjoyed a pre-dinner cocktail from the comforts of a Singapore River Cruise.

	
	
	

	
	
	Farewell dinner
	Guests were treated to the fabulous food and casual, elegant ambience of CUT. The scrumptious food and attentive service of the staff served as the perfect end to a great meeting in Singapore. As a farewell gift, participants were given Risis souvenirs personalised with their individual Zodiac signs, symbolising a traditional blessing to them and their business.
