            9. Hunt for inspired curios
		
            
            
    
            
            
                
                    
                    
                    
                
            
    

            
            
                
                    Swing by Kampong Glam if you’re in the mood for a spot of treasure-hunting. The district is a tantalising blend of Malay heritage and innovative new establishments. Of particular note is Haji Lane, where quirky boutiques sit shoulder to shoulder with traditional wares like Persian carpets and kebaya (traditional nonya dress) dresses.
