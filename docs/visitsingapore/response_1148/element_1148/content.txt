The results of the 2018 Singapore Michelin star list are in, with five new restaurants being added to the constellation of establishments in Singapore that have been awarded for their culinary excellence.
Arguably the most coveted culinary accolade in the world, the Michelin star list celebrates the top dining establishments around the globe, with each star denoting grades of excellence. Restaurants are rated based on five criteria: quality of ingredients used, mastery of cooking technique and flavours, projection of the chef’s personality in his or her cuisine, value for money and consistency over time and across the entire menu.
There’s a flavour to suit every palate in Singapore, so dig into our guide to this year’s winners (newly-awarded establishments are denoted with an [N] for your convenience).

Before moving to Singapore in 1996, he honed his skills at Lei Garden in Hong Kong, where he learnt to employ what he humbly terms ‘modest cooking techniques’ to bring out the natural flavours of the best ingredients.
The signature dishes here include poached fish noodles with lobster meat, barbecued Iberico pork in honey sauce and braised four-head South African abalone.
