Foodies meet

            
            
                Treat yourself to delicacies at Michelin-starred restaurants. But do save some tummy space for the long and diverse list of must-tries―from lip-smacking dishes by time-tested hawker heroes to scrumptious creations by award-winning homegrown chefs. Every meal is a chance to indulge in something different, in new atmospheres, and in new ways. If you’re passionate about food, here’s where the foodies―connoisseurs, gourmands, bakers, chefs, mixologists, chocolatiers, tastemakers―meet.

	        	Fun after sunset
	        
	        Singapore’s nightlife scene has exploded into a dizzying whirl of music, drink and entertainment that caters to both party animals and those seeking a quieter night out – all around the clock. Dance to the beats of world-class DJs at a megaclub, enjoy a bespoke tipple at a discreet cocktail bar or check out a live band before having a big laugh at a comedy club. Crank up the volume or dial it down to a more comfortable pace. The choices are limited only by your imagination, and how long you take to recover the next day.

Whether you drink your wine to unwind or to party it up, here are six wine bars where you can enjoy a glass—or three.
		                                            
		                                        
		                                    
		                                    
		                                
		                                
		                                
		                                    
		                                        
		                                        
		                                            
		                                                Whisky bars in Singapore
		                                                
		                                            
		                                            
		                                                Whether you’re a dram devotee or you can’t tell apart whiskey from whisky (hint: the former’s Scottish while the latter’s Irish and American), these five bars will raise your spirits.
