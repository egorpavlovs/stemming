	                        Ranked as the Best Street Food City in 2013, Singapore can please anyone with $4 to $400 for a meal adventure. Explore the heartlands, off the beaten and eating tracks, that's where true blue local food culture resides.

	                        Hawker fare is my Singapore! They are simply delicious, value for money and a melting pot of culture. Da Dong Prawn Noodle is my favorite and my wish is our hawker heroes will one day be as famous as the great Sushi Masters of Japan.

                            Singapore's 'national' dish.
This delectable dish can be found at almost every dining spot, from humble hawker centres to high-end restaurants.

                            Chilli crab hits all the right spots with tangy gravy that seeps into the succulent flesh of the stir-fried crab.

                            This spicy dish is a scintillating stew of curry cooked with vegetables and of course, the whole head of a fish.

                            Contrary to its name, there's nary a tinge of orange in the local fried carrot cake, a flavourful dish that comes in the monochrome colours of black or white.

                            The laksa broth offers the right balance of spice and coconut milk, a distinctive noodle soup that will tickle the tastebuds.

                            It's the savoury and creamy rice that carries this dish, with spicy sambal to give it that extra zing.
                        
                    
                
                
            
        	
                
                
        		
        		
        	
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Rojak
                        
                        
                            Dark and sticky, the salad may not look very appealing at first; but tuck into this culinary marvel and you’ll be amazed by the delicious mix of sweet and savoury.
                        
                    
                
                
            
        	
        	
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Roti Prata
                        
                        
                            This Indian specialty is pleasing to the palate and the eye. Watch the prata-maker stretch the dough by slapping and swinging it in one skilful motion.
