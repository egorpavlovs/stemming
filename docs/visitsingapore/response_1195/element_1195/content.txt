		Orchard Road’s humble beginnings date back to the early 1830s, when it was an unnamed road home to fruit orchards, nutmeg plantations and pepper farms. In 1958, Orchard Road’s first department store—TANGS—was set up by local merchant C.K. Tang. Then known as House of Tangs, it marked the neighbourhood’s first step towards becoming Singapore’s most beloved shopping district.
Orchard Road’s bustling boulevard is now a retail and dining paradise, with over 5,000 establishments offering the ultimate lifestyle experience to tourists and locals alike.

		Start your retail journey at TANGS. One of Singapore’s oldest department store, this shopping centre’s design pays homage to the Forbidden City, with idiosyncratic Eastern architectural features like its jade-green pagoda-esque roof and iconic red columns. The establishment is stocked with well-known brands, Asian collectibles and unique souvenirs.
For a study in contrast, take a stroll down Orchard Road and make your way to ION Orchard, one of Singapore’s most dazzling shopping complexes. This famously futuristic-looking mall houses over eight levels of stores, from luxury brands to high street fashion and entertainment stores.
	


        

		
        

		
        
			
                
                
                  
			
		

		
        

		
		Connossieurs of fine spirits should pay a visit to The Grande Whisky Collection, on the fifth floor of ION Orchard. This museum boasts over 4,500 of the world’s rarest and oldest whiskies, and a gift shop with a special selection of Scottish and Japanese labels. Tastings and intimate guided tours are held on a regular basis, making it a fine place to expand your understanding of this much-beloved spirit.
To take a break from shopping and enjoy a bout of artistic immersion, pay a visit to the ION Art Gallery. This art space features a range of international and local exhibitions that will inspire your inner creative.
Round off your shopping spree with a visit to Far East Plaza, a haven for street fashion enthusiasts and bargain hunters alike. This mall houses a range of trendy street apparel stores, affordable beauty services and great deals on electronic products.

To experience a truly global meal, drop by Wild Honey in Mandarin Gallery. This quiet little café brings the dishes of various nations under one roof, allowing visiting epicures to further their appreciation of global cuisine. The restaurant offers a delectable array of sandwiches, meats and salads from countries like Italy, Turkey and Mexico.
For a world class drinking experience, make a beeline for Manhattan, housed within the Regent Hotel. Crowned top bar on the Asia’s 50 Best Bars 2018 list, this grand hotel bar boasts artisanal spirits, craft bartending and an ambience that evokes the golden age of drinking at the turn of the 19th century.
