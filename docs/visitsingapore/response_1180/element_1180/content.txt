Whether you’re an insatiable foodie, a lover of the arts or an irrepressible daredevil, Singapore’s endless possibilities are certain to fuel the fires of your passion. Here’s a peek into what the Lion City has in store for you.

		
            
            
		
		
		

        
            1. Thrills, spills and nonstop action
		
            
            
    
            
            
                
                    
                    
                    
                
            
    

            
            
                
                    From high-flying thrills to up-close encounters with the creatures of the night, Singapore is filled with activities that’ll have you channelling your inner action hero.
To soar high on adrenaline, hop on a cable car and make your way to Sentosa. This island resort’s dizzying array of attractions include the world’s largest wind tunnel for indoor skydiving, movie-inspired rides at Universal Studios Singapore™ and Mega Adventure – Singapore, home to Southeast Asia’s steepest zip wire.
Adrenaline seekers who’d like to walk on the wild side should also pay a visit to Singapore’s award-winning Night Safari, the world’s first nocturnal zoo, home to over 2,500 animals from 130 species.

                
            

			
			


        
            2. A rich tapestry of arts and culture
		
            
            
    
            
            
                
                    
                    
                    
                
            
    

            
            
                
                    While Singapore boasts a spectacular array of galleries, theatres and museums, it’s also a city where art can be found on street corners, sidewalks and shophouse walls.
Spend a day in the heart of the city, and find inspiration in Singapore’s Civic District. The area houses a multitude of world-class galleries and museums, including the National Museum of Singapore, the Singapore Art Museum and National Gallery Singapore. The latter is home to over 8000 pieces of art from Singapore’s National Collection, and has hosted exhibitions from internationally acclaimed artists like Yayoi Kusama and Martin Creed.
Alternatively, embark on a hunt for some of Singapore’s most iconic street art in the neighbourhoods of Bras Basah.Bugis, Tiong Bahru and Little India.

                
            

			
			


        
            3. Global labels meet local artisans
		
            
            
    
            
            
                
                    
                    
                    
                
            
    

            
            
                
                    Fashionistas and bargain hunters alike will find that Singapore is a treasure trove of shopping options.
Your first stop for a spot of retail therapy should be Orchard Road, Singapore’s premiere shopping belt. Whether you’re hunting for bargain buys at Far East Plaza or shopping for the latest threads from international labels like Giorgio Armani and Marc Jacobs, there’s bound to be an emporium to suit your tastes.
To peruse labours of love made in the Lion City, pay a visit to the bustling bohemian borough of Holland Village. We recommend browsing the racks of local fashion boutique Ong Shunmugam and exploring the craftsmanship on display at bookbinding atelier Bynd Artisan.

                
            

			
			


        
            4. Paradise for foodies
		
            
            
    
            
            
                
                    
                    
                    
                
            
    

            
            
                
                    Eating is said to be a classically Singaporean past-time, and it’s not difficult to see why. The Lion City is home to a constellation of Michelin-starred restaurants, ranging from Japanese fusion dishes at Beni to French cuisine at Odette.
Besides internationally acclaimed establishments, our city’s diverse culinary landscape is best exemplified in its local hawker culture. To sample true-blue hawker eats, drop by Chinatown Complex Food Centre, a sprawling hawker centre that houses over 260 food stalls. The world’s most affordable Michelin-starred meal—Liao Fan Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice and Noodle—can be found here.

                
            

			
			


        
            5. A city of green sanctuaries
		
            
            
    
            
            
                
                    
                    
                    
                
            
    

            
            
                
                    Often described as a City in a Garden, Singapore’s urban landscape is dotted with verdant parks, unspoilt sanctuaries and lush green spaces.
Uncover Singapore’s history in tranquil Fort Canning Park, marvel at the futuristic beauty of Gardens by the Bay or spend the afternoon strolling through the Singapore Botanic Gardens—Singapore’s first UNESCO World Heritage site.
Avid explorers who’d like to spend the entire day amidst the wonders of nature can take a bumboat to Pulau Ubin, an island that’s home to rich ecosystems, teeming wildlife and diverse landscapes.

                
            

			
			


        
            6. Nightlife
		
            
            
    
            
            
                
                    
                    
                    
                
            
    

            
            
                
                    Whether you’re a lover of live music, a rave fanatic who digs indie beats or just looking to soak in the party vibes, the Lion City is filled with opportunities for new revelries.
For starters, be sure to spend an evening at Clarke Quay, home to world-class dance clubs like Zouk, rock n’ roll venues like Crazy Elephant, and a plethora of themed bars to wet your whistle. Fans of retro culture should check out Level Up, a bar that pays homage to the video game arcades of the ‘90s.
Cocktail connoisseurs and drinking purists alike can choose from a multitude of award-winning drinking spots, ranging from the ultra-luxe, 1920s-inspired ATLAS to Manhattan, the latter dubbed the top establishment on the Asia’s 50 Best Bars 2018 list.

                
            

			
			


        
            7. Passion all-year round
		
            
            
    
            
            
                
                    
                    
                    
                
            
    

            
            
                
                    Singapore’s status as a global metropolis means that visitors get to enjoy a thrilling annual line-up of art festivals, music extravaganzas and sporting events. No matter the time of the year you’re visiting, you’re bound to find a festivity to fuel your passion.
Sports fans hoping to experience adrenaline rushes on the pitch, field and the racetrack can look forward to the HSBC Singapore Rugby Sevens, the International Champions Cup Singapore and the legendary Grand Prix Season Singapore respectively. If you’re in the mood to dance, be sure to time your trip to coincide with much-beloved dance parties like ULTRA Singapore and ZoukOut.
Lovers of culture, heritage and art should peruse the artwork on display at Singapore Art Week, or soak in the vibes of local cultural festivities like Hari Raya Aidilfitri and Chinese New Year.
