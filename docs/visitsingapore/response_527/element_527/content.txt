	    Overview
	






	    Jointly organised by Koelnmesse and the Singapore Dental Association, the International Dental Exhibition and Meeting (IDEM) Singapore returned from April 8 - 10 2016.
	




	
	
	
	Recognised as Asia’s most comprehensive dental trade exhibition and conference and the top dental event in the Asia-Pacific, the event was officially launched by Guest-of-Honour, Mr. Gan Kim Yong, Minister of Health, Singapore, at the Suntec Convention and Exhibition Centre. 
The 9th edition saw more than 8,000 visitors and 500 leading companies in the dental industry showcasing their latest innovations and technologies, with 87% of them being international exhibitors. A total of 12 country pavilions including France, Germany, Switzerland, Taiwan and newcomer Brazil were present to provide support and representation while promoting the dental industry of their country.
“Since its inception in 2000, IDEM Singapore has grown by leaps and bounds. There has been a steady increase in the number of participants for this biennial event and we are proud that our organisation has played a key role in bringing dental healthcare professionals, manufacturers and distributors to a converging point for those who are aiming to become a player in the Asian market,” said Mr. Michael Dreyer, Vice President, Asia Pacific, Koelnmesse Pte Ltd.

	
	
	

	
	Singapore a hub for dental innovation
	
	Themed “Striving for Clinical Excellence”, some 36 regional and international experts and speakers were slated in the packed conference programme. Leading lights including Linda Greenwall, Specialist in Restorative Dentistry and Prosthodontics, Ray Williams, Professor of Periodontology, and Raymond Yukna, Professor of Advanced Periodontal Therapies, were present to share their knowledge through lectures, round table discussions and hands-on workshops.
The next edition of IDEM Singapore 2018 will be held from April 13-15 2018 at Suntec Singapore. More information is available athttp://www.idem-singapore.com/.
IDEM Singapore 2016 also expanded its education offerings to include a new Digital Dentistry Forum themed ‘A Primer in Digital Dentistry – Practice and Laboratory Development for Clinical Excellence’. The speakers addressed the benefits of digital technologies such as CAD/CAM, 3-D printing, and CAT scans, as well as ways to easily adopt and transition to dental care in the digital world.

	
	
	

	
	
	
	To further cement its aim in striving for clinical excellence while highlighting the importance of innovative technologies, IDEM Singapore 2016 provided visitors with the opportunity to view the latest dental innovations in clinical dentistry, digital technology and patient care products.  
“With the mix of lectures, workshops, forums and roundtable discussions, IDEM Singapore provided a great opportunity for all dental professionals to interact with one another, gather new knowledge and information from the world’s finest clinicians and learn to make informed decisions about best practices and delivery of the finest patient care,” said Dr. David Alexander, IDEM Singapore 2016 Scientific Programme Director.
