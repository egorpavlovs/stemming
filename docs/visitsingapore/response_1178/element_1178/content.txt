In this city that never sleeps, why should you? Even in the wee hours of the morning, there’s plenty to do: exercise your brain as you crack puzzles, admire the twinkling stars while cruising along the coast or soak in an indoor hot Jacuzzi. After all, the night is always young in Singapore.

		
            
            
		
		
		

        
            Escape a locked room
		
            
            
    
            
            
                
                    
                    
                    
                
            
    

            
            
                
                    Think you can crack puzzles in order to escape a room before your time runs out? Escape rooms are aplenty in Singapore, and Fridays and Saturdays are when they stay open the latest. Brave ones who like horror and gore will enjoy the scares in the rooms at Breakout, while the mind-boggling puzzles at LOST SG will push your wit to its limits.
But if you don’t want to put too much strain on your mind, Trapped offers less strenuous family-friendly rooms that allow children as young as seven to participate.

                There are buzzing dart machines and beer on tap at all of iDarts’ six outlets in the city—enough to keep you occupied for a good five to six hours. Even if you’re a dart novice, you can still pick up the game and make a new like-minded friend. Just seek help from iDarts’ staff, who’ll teach you tips and tricks to climb the scoreboard.
iDarts Halo. Bugis+, 201 Victoria Street #03-24, Singapore 188067. +65 6634 9662. Mon-Thu & Sun 12.30pm-1am; Fri & Sat 12.30pm-3am.

                    Knock it out of the park with a different kind of Friday night party at Orchid Bowl. At 10pm, the fluorescent lights at Orchid Bowl are dimmed, and the entire bowling alley comes to life with disco lights and groovy dance music. Coupled with luminous glow-in-the-dark bowling balls and pins, Orchid Bowl’s cosmic bowling nights (from S$20) takes the ‘galaxy’ trend to a whole new level. Book a lane in advance to avoid disappointment.

                Cast your rod, floater and hook into one of the massive ponds at Hai Bin (from S$20), and knock back a beer as you wait for a prawn to snatch at your bait. This favourite night-time activity has reeled in locals, both young and old. There’s no need for any equipment—all of the gear required are available for rent. The best part? You can taste the fruit of your labour by grilling your catch on site.

            Night cycling at East Coast Park

                    Feel the cool breeze in your hair as you cruise along the well-lit bike paths of East Coast Park. Coastline Leisure is a bike rental shop that’s open 24/7, but consider trying out a bike sharing service, too. oBike, Mobike and ofo rent out two-wheelers at the tap of a mobile app. For a route that’s as easy as it is scenic, make your way from East Coast Park to Gardens by the Bay and Marina Bay Sands®.
Find supper haunts along your cycling route to fuel up. For a great hawker selection, check out Lau Pa Sat in the Central Business District or East Coast Lagoon Food Village for dishes like char kway teow (flat rice noodles) and sambal (chilli paste) stingray.
Coastline Leisure has two outlets in East Coast Park:
East Coast Park Carpark E2. 1220 East Coast Parkway, Singapore 468960. +65 6443 3489.
 Daily 24 hours.
East Coast Park Carpark B1. 720 East Coast Parkway, Singapore 439174.

            Play a game of futsal
		
            
            
    
            
            
    

            
            
                For those travelling in a big group of friends, kick off a five-a-side futsal game at recreational complex ORTO (from S$50 an hour per court). You don’t have to have the skills of Messi—the futsal pitch is equipped with stadium-like floodlights and state-of-the-art sound systems that will make you feel like a football star.
After all that physical exertion, hearty grub is, thankfully, just a stone’s throw away. There are seven eateries housed within ORTO: Bistro V, Quench! Bistro & Bar, Aroy Jing Jing and Mookata open until the wee hours.
ORTO. 81 Lorong Chencharu, Singapore 679198. +65 6303 0663.

            Luxuriate in a late-night spa
		
            
            
    
            
            
                
                    
                    
                    
                
            
    

            
            
                
                    After a day spent sightseeing, put your feet up, literally, at the 24-hour g.Spa (from S$60). Dip into a hot or cold pool and position your feet in front of the water jets for a makeshift reflexology massage, or sweat it out in steam and sauna rooms. Ease those tight muscles with a professional Chinese Meridian therapy massage (S$228) that will work out all the kinks in your body. After the massage, park yourself on one of the comfy couches in the relaxation lounge or tuck into g.Spa’s complimentary all-night buffet.
g.Spa. 102 Guillemard Road #02-01, Singapore 399719. +65 6280 8988. 
 Daily 24 hours.
