	    Overview
	






	    Singapore's spectacular new art gallery is also a great space to host events
	




	
	
	
	National Gallery Singapore occupies the premises of the former Supreme Court and City Hall. Opened in November 2015, it is Singapore’s newest museum and houses the largest public collection of modern art in Singapore and Southeast Asia.
Located in the heart of the Civic District and just a three-minute walk from City Hall MRT Station, it is a cultural attraction not to be missed.

	Siapa Nama Kamu, DBS Singapore Gallery
	
	
	The visual representation of history on display at the Gallery spans more than 8,000 works from the 19th century till today, encompassing all media forms, including paintings, sculptures, printmaking, photography and video.

	
	
	

	Former Supreme Court Terrace
	
	
	The colonial-built Supreme Court and City Hall heritage buildings received a modern restoration in anticipation of the Gallery’s opening and are visions to behold. Exhibits are now displayed in what used to be courtrooms, the Chief Justice’s chamber and office, and holding rooms. The nostalgic beauty of the buildings’ intricate architecture has been lovingly preserved and certainly complements the contents within.
With its lovely marriage of art and architecture, the Gallery is a grand place to host events. All the venue spaces at the Gallery exude an old-world charm. Perhaps the most spectacular is the Supreme Court Terrace, which can hold 130 people and is an ideal setting for upscale product launches and corporate evenings. Situated under a skylight roof, the terrace sits around the iconic Rotunda dome of the former Law Library, allowing guests to look into a slice of the old Supreme Court. Looking for a smaller venue with the same stately ambience? An extension of the Supreme Court Terrrace, the Glass Room can accommodate 60 people and overlooks the Rotunda dome. 

	
	
	

	Padang Deck
	
	
	The auditorium, located in the City Hall Wing, comes with a state-of-the-art audio-visual system and is the largest venue of the museum with a seating capacity of 208. Together with its attached foyer that can accommodate 60 people, event organisers can hold film screenings, performances, award ceremonies and seminars here.
Enjoy evening cocktails with stuning views of the Singapore skyline at the Padang Deck, Coleman Deck or City Hall Veranda, which can fit 74, 55 and 30 guests respectively. 

	
	
	

	National Kitchen
	
	
	Mundane meetings can be made more exciting at the Gallery’s five seminar rooms. Each seats between 15 and 25 people and are fitted with LCD screens and speakers for fuss-free event organising.
You can also opt to hold a corporate function at any of the restaurants at the Gallery, which offer a variety of cuisines, including Singaporean (National Kitchen by Violet Oon), French (Odette), Indian (Saha), and Cantonese (Yàn). Some dining establishments, such as the Aura Sky Lounge , and Smoke & Mirrors, are strategically located to present the best views of the city skyline.
