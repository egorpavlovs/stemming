                            From historic temples to hip new bars, Singapore’s Chinatown has it all for both trailblazers and lovers of the traditional.

                                        Old meets new in spectacular fashion after dark, when the streets of Chinatown come alive with light, music and merriment.

		Once an enclave for Singapore’s Chinese immigrant population, the Chinatown of today is much-beloved for its blend of old and new, with historic temples and traditional medicinal halls sitting alongside hip new bars and lifestyle shops.
Whether you’re visiting century-old temples at Telok Ayer and Kreta Ayer or making new friends at a bar in Duxton or Keong Saik, there’s always a new experience in Chinatown.

		Gain insights into Singapore’s rich, multi-ethnic culture by visiting some of the country’s oldest places of worship, located in the heart of Chinatown.
Culture lovers looking to immerse themselves in Buddhism’s rich art and history should pay a visit to the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple. The temple’s interior is architecturally designed in the form of a mandala, a central concept in Buddhist and Hindu spirituality that represents universal connection.
	


        

		
        

		
        
			
                
                
                  
			
		

		
        

		
		From the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple, take a short jaunt down South Bridge Road, and keep an eye out for Sri Mariamman Temple, the oldest Hindu temple in Singapore. Constructed by immigrants in 1827, this place of worship is dedicated to the goddess Mariamman, known for her power in curing epidemics, illnesses and disease.
Located just a stone’s throw away on Mosque Street is Jamae Mosque, built as a place of worship for Chinatown’s Tamil Muslim population. Colloquially referred to as Periya Palli (‘Big Mosque’ in Tamil), the mosque’s iconic architectural style makes it a must-see for urban explorers.

		Whether you’re a food lover exploring the traditional flavours of a country or a gourmand who loves fusion and experimentation, Chinatown’s diverse food offerings are certain to sate your appetite.
A perfect example of Chinatown’s old-meets-new food offerings, Chinatown Food Street provides visiting foodies a culinary smorgasbord of well-loved Singaporean hawker food, ranging from char kway teow (stir-fried noodles) and satay (grilled skewered meat) to roast duck and South Indian curries.
Foodies looking for behind-the-scenes insight into the preparation of Japanese dishes should visit Man Man Japanese Unagi Restaurant, a Michelin Bib Gourmand restaurant at Keong Saik Road. Prime seats in the house overlook the kitchen, which features the chef’s live performance of gutting and cleaning the unagi (eel) before grilling it over a charcoal fire pit.

                Did you know?
                In the early years, clan groups lived in different areas: The Hokkiens in Telok Ayer and the waterfront, the Teochews along Singapore River (Clarke Quay) and around Fort Canning, and the Cantonese and Hakka in Kreta Ayer.
The Chinese name for Chinatown directly translates to the words ‘ox’, ‘cart’ and ‘water’. This refers to the bullock carts that brought much of the water supply to this district in the 19th century.
