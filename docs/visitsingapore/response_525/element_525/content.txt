	    Overview
	




	
	    
	        
                
                
	            
	            
	        
    








	
	
	
	The European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Asia Congress was held for the first time in Singapore from December 18-21, 2015.
Endorsed by 11 of the most important and influential Asian oncology Associations in the region including China, Japan and India, the inaugural ESMO Asia Congress attracted more than 2,700 international medical practitioners and experts to grace the event.

	
	
	




	
	    
	        
                
                
	            
	            
	        
    








	
	
	
	Speaking on why Singapore was chosen to host the congress’ first Asian edition, ESMO president Professor Rolf A. Stahel said, “Singapore is a perfect fit for the first-ever ESMO Asia Congress, with its geographical location that makes it a convenient travel hub for international delegates. Coupled with the state-of-the-art event facilities, I’m confident hosting ESMO Asia here presents an optimal opportunity for the exchange of expertise across Asian and European cultures and help to elevate the field of oncology further.”
Indeed, the four-day congress in Singapore was a platform for experts in the oncological field to network, collaborate and promote the international exchange of expertise. An international scientific committee of experts from both Asia and Europe developed an extensive programme of 12 scientific and educational tracks for the congress. Strong emphasis was placed on the state of art scientific advances and the current standards of care across major tumour types.
The strong support from the industry had also made possible innovative sessions such as ESMO Colloquia, which brought together top experts to discuss evolving areas of interest such as angiogenesis (or development of new blood vessels) across tumour types. Participants could also attend the industry supported satellite symposiums to learn more about the current and future developments of oncology. In addition, sponsors were also able to engage with Asian prescribers to present their latest products and services.
Besides the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Asia, Singapore will also be hosting more medical conferences in 2016, such as SpineWeek 2016 and the annual meeting and exhibition of The International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (ISMRM), both held in May 2016. ESMO Asia will also continue to be held in Singapore for a second year at the end of 2016.
