	    City in the garden
	




	
	Head beyond the conference hall for a dose of vitamin D and some of the lushest venues on the island
	
	Since the start of the country’s journey to be a garden city in 1963, Singapore has come a long way to become the world-class City in a Garden that it is today. Last year, there was much fanfare when the Singapore Botanic Gardens was officially designated a UNESCO World Heritage site, even as the Gardens started work on a new extension. Besides an expanded Botanic Gardens, residents and visitors alike can look forward to new parks in the heartlands and a revitalised Green Corridor, as part of Singapore’s evolving City in the Garden vision.  
Here are a few green spaces around Singapore that make a great backdrop for conferences, meetings and corporate bonding excursions.



	
	
	




	Supertrees by Gardens by the bay
	Gardens by the Bay
	
	The biggest attractions at Gardens by the Bay, Singapore’s second Botanic Gardens in the heart of Marina Bay, are the domed conservatories. The Cloud Forest features a 35-metre-tall mountain as well as the world’s tallest indoor waterfall, while the Flower Dome replicates the climate of spring in the Mediterranean.
The Flower Field Hall, nestled within the Flower Dome is a breathtakingly picturesque venue that can fit between 700 and 1100 guests – ideal for fashion shows, gala dinners and special themed corporate events.

	Coney Island by National Parks Board
	Coney Island
	
	Nature lovers will appreciate the wide variety of habitats at the 50-hectare Coney Island Park. These include coastal forests, grasslands, mangroves and Casuarina woodlands.
The island also is home to over 80 species of birds and is a must-see for birdwatchers. For a change of environment after long days indoors at conferences, this is a great and easy trekking spot with peers and colleagues.  
For more information, visit here.

	
	
	

	
	Kranji Marshes
	
	Another ecological haven is the Kranji Marshes located along Kranji Reservoir. As one of the largest freshwater marshes on the island, flora and fauna are aplenty and many species of birds, butterflies and dragonflies call the place home.
Newly opened to the public in February 2016, the Kranji Marshes is a site ideal for intimate team bonding sessions. Much effort is put into conserving all wildlife in the marshes, so visitors are strongly advised to keep the surroundings pristine.

	Park Connectors
	
	Singapore’s park connectors are a great way to visit a series of parks, gardens and waterways that are in close proximity to each other.
One that is close to the city is the Southern Ridges. Ten kilometres long, it connects Mount Faber Park, Telok Blangah Hill Park, HortPark, Kent Ridge Park and Labrador Nature Reserve. Venture on the Henderson Waves, an undulating waveform bridge and the highest pedestrian bridge in the country, or the Forest Walk alongside the canopy of trees and a great trail for bird watching.
At HortPark, there are several indoor and outdoor venues you can book for events large and small. These range from meeting rooms that can accommodate 16, 25 or 50 people for corporate workshops to the Event Lawn and Exhibition Gallery for gala events or company D&Ds.
