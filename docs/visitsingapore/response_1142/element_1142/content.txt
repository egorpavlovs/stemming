		Southeast Asia's first Hollywood movie theme park, Universal Studios Singapore™, features an enticing selection of attractions, rides and entertainment for families and thrill seekers. Indeed, 18 out of the 24 movie-themed rides here were designed just for the Singapore park.

There are seven movie-themed zones, and each is uniquely designed. You will find the renowned Hollywood Walk of Fame at the Hollywood zone. As you venture into New York, the landscape evolves into impressive city skylines, including a mock-up of a subway entrance. Here, you can step onto a movie set and experience the destructive force of a hurricane with special effects produced by Steven Spielberg.
	


        Breathtaking rides

		
        

		
        

		
        

		
		Sci-Fi City features the famous TRANSFORMERS The Ride: The Ultimate 3D Battle ride where you fight evil forces in heart-pounding 3D combat. Move on to Ancient Egypt and face mummies and scarab beetles on an indoor roller coaster in total darkness—all the better to ignite your fears. In Madagascar, prepare to be drenched in a wet river boat ride. 
	


        Thrills and spills

		
        

		
        

		
        

		
		Performances here are equally spectacular. The young ones will love the Shrek 4-D Adventure at Far Far Away. This fun cinematic experience allows you to physically feel the action of the movie. In the Lost World, witness death-defying stunts and explosions in WaterWorld™, a live performance.

After an exhilarating day out, replenish your energy between the attractions and step in to the many themed restaurants across the parks. Do have your camera ready for “celebrity” sightings!
