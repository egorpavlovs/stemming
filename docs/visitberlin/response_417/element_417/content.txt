            Any more questions? Welcome to Q Berlin Questions 2018

                      

                    

                            

          


          
          First off: What connects a Mexican-American life scientist, an American sci-fi author and a Russian expert on cloning? And then many, many more questions – ethical, social, scientific, scholarly and cultural. For example, the question of justice and equality in our society. Or ethical borders in an increasingly digitalised world. Or identity in the era of globalisation. Questions that affect – and connect – us all. But how often do we have the chance to join the visionary thinkers and leading minds of our day to discuss these issues and look for answers? All too rarely. Which makes an event like Q Berlin Questions 2018 all the more exciting. From 16 – 17 November, the Q event in Berlin’s ewerk considers some of the key questions of today – with an international team of experts in an exceptional conference format.

        The right location for the big issues

    
  

  


          
          This year’s Q Berlin Questions focuses on three major polarising issues: ‘identity vs. diversity’, ‘science vs. ethics’ and ‘self-determination vs. power’. In Q 2017, the first edition of this series, it was already clear that important topics need a special format – creative, authentic and open. A format allowing the abstract to be grasped tangibly and considered in all its many facets. And a location where such a format can be realised – and that means Berlin. After all, as Iris Lanz, Director Conventions at the visitBerlin Convention Office, points out, “Berlin has a global reputation as a place where you can freely discuss interesting and controversial content – in all imaginable meetings and conference formats.”

        
      
    

  

      
        Sharing ideas and thinking laterally

    
  

  


          
          And so in cooperation with red onion and the visitBerlin Convention Office, the city of Berlin is once again hosting a broad scientific and scholarly debate with speakers from a range of countries and sectors – from a science fiction author to the Labour Society Think Tank at the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs (BMAS) and a former President of Mexico! As Iris Lanz explains, “This is a panel of people with something to say”. People who enjoy thinking outside the box, listening and sharing their ideas as equals with around 400 participants in a creative conference programme comprising kick-off speeches, discussions and music.

        
      
    

  
  



  
  
    
        


                


  
            




      

          


  
            




      

          


  
            




      

          


  
            




      

          
          
          
          
      

    
  



  

      
        Berlin as an impetus for innovation

    
  

  


          
          The Q Berlin Questions is, at the same time, an impetus for innovation in Berlin’s MICE sector – at the latest on the second day, when participants go local for a different perspective on the big issues in Germany’s capital city. As Iris Lanz says, “This event points to the untapped potential in the meetings and convention sector.” And it does so exactly where questions arise, where answers are lived and changes evident – in the neighbourhoods. On five tours to Berlin’s hotspots, locations and institutions, Q takes its guests behind the scenes to offer them remarkable and unique insights and interesting platforms for exchanges.

Is that going to answer all the questions? Almost certainly not. But those questions can then still be intensely debated and discussed afterwards – for example, at a private lunch with Berlin scholars and scientists, politicians and cultural practitioners. And, not least, lateral thinkers.
