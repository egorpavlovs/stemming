            Practical tests for event formats: Open Space

                      

                    

                              Events have changed in recent years: monological lectures are now supplemented by interactive formats. Digitisation offers additional possibilities for involving participants. Open-Space is one of the formats that have gained popularity in recent years. It focuses on the participants' exchange of experience. We will show you the possibilities for this format and give you tips to help you with implementation.

Open Space: Openness for creativity and interactivity

Open Space is particularly suitable for conferences with a number of participants of up to 2,000 people. What is special about the format is that there is no planned agenda for the year with defined lectures. Open Space is much more likely to be actively used by all participants. Instead of a stage and a podium programme, a guiding theme is introduced at the beginning in the plenary session. Each participant can contribute their own topics and questions to the discussion. The participants then organise themselves into working groups and then work on their topics. There is a time frame, but there are no guidelines. All materials for workshops and ample space are offered, supplemented by a catering area. The participants determine the breaks themselves and can move between the groups according to the "butterfly principle".


Did you know?

Open Space was invented over 30 years ago by Harrison Owen. After he painstakingly planned a conference, and then realised that the best ideas were created during the unplanned coffee breaks.

Open Space: Berlin shows format

For the first Berlin MICE Summit, the get-together of the Berlin meeting industry in January 2016, we were also looking at the format. Under the motto "Berlin: fit for the future - strong in the competition" experts from the hotel industry, Berlin politics and the cultural sector discussed Berlins' future potential and developed ideas and fields of action to further advance the meeting and congress market of the capital.



Open participatory format. Very good for communicating with each other and for the development of various themes.


— Participants statement by Dr. Thorsten Knoll - TUBS GmbH


Open space works according to four rules. We have implemented them for the Berlin MICE Summit:

1. The number of participants is of secondary importance. It was important that the participants choose their work group according to personal interest.

2. Moderation: as much as necessary, as little as possible. At the Berlin MICE Summit the participants were the main focus. We left them to discuss them freely and provided no directions to the discussion.

3. Time management lies with the participants. Working time and creative breaks could be divided flexibly.

4. Themes are not restated. A subject is fully discussed, the working group is disbanded and the participants can switch to other workshops.

Successful Berlin MICE Summit thanks to Open Space 

Open Space proved to be the right format for the first Berlin MICE Summit. The approximately 270 industry experts were able to discuss the topics themselves, to discuss them in the plenary session, and to find viable solutions. The location - the Alte Kindl brewery warehouse - offered us the necessary spatial flexibility for the congress industry day. In the former industrial hall, we were able to set up a stage area and a plenary area with seats for all as well as individual areas for group discussions. The rugged charm of the warehouse also provided the participants with a suitable framework for their creative exchange.

                We are brilliantly connected - both (inter)nationally and regionally with a unique partner network.
              
                                      
                
                We are engaged free of charge because we act for you by order of the city.
              
                                      
                
                We are neutral because we represent the entire offerings of Berlin.
