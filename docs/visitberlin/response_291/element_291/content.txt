            Incentives Berlin: Unforgettable moments for your participants

                      

                    

                              Recognition is the best form of motivation: Berlin ensures this by offering a wide range of extraordinary incentives, not only suitable for small team events but also for large company events. Pamper your participants with culinary highlights or get active during archery or a digital scavenger hunt.

Keep an overview: our Meeting Guide Berlin offers you a wide selection of Berlin incentives, sorted by different categories.

Incentives: Luxury, Trabi-Safari and archery in Berlin

Incentives in Berlin are as versatile as the city itself: the options present the historical or modern side of the German capital. The Trabi-Safari allows your participants to experience the history of Berlin whilst driving past the former wall or the Brandenburg Gate. A tour of the Berlin Underworlds leads to old bunkers and catacombs – the ideal combination of suspense and history.

Berlin sportive: Instead of sitting in a bus, let your participants experience the city via bike. In contrast, archery or cross golf on the Teufelsberg are bound to relaxation and help one concentrate. The Adventuretour offers more action with its scavenger hunt 2.0. Even Berlin locals will be thrilled by this incentive.

Berlin is ranked among the world’s most popular fashion and design capitals and offers incentives for style experts and people with a strong sense for aestheticism. Let your participants experience the creative flair of the capital by planning a tour through the district of Mitte. The boutiques and studios of young designers can be found here.

Incentives: Gourmets and sustainability in Berlin

It doesn’t always have to be a formal dinner; Berlin offers interesting alternatives. What about a crime dinner instead? In the end it’s not always the gardener, maybe your colleague is involved… Experience a gripping crime case with your participants and try to solve the question of who in your group might be the possible offender. Alternatively, experience a Gourmet Liner Dinner with star studded status. Enjoy the starter at Brandenburg Gate, the main course at the Gedächtniskirche and dessert at Alexanderplatz: the Gourmettour on the driving luxury restaurant can be arranged individually.

In case you have found your Berlin incentive through our Meeting Guide Berlin, you will also find the respective contact person there, for a fast and uncomplicated communication.

                We are brilliantly connected - both (inter)nationally and regionally with a unique partner network.
              
                                      
                
                We are engaged free of charge because we act for you by order of the city.
              
                                      
                
                We are neutral because we represent the entire offerings of Berlin.
