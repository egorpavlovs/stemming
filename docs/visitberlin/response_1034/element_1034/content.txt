        Four principal areas in sustainability

    
  

  


          
          The partners listed on the Sustainable Meetings Berlin platform have been checked against an extensive catalogue of criteria (only available in German). Based on internationally recognised and valid guidelines and frameworks, the catalogue is the result of an intensive development process working together with experts. Rather than being a checklist, the catalogue of criteria is a sophisticated instrument to anchor and evolve corporate sustainability in the event industry and drive forwards a process of constant improvement.

The listed partners have to demonstrate sustainability in four principal areas:

        
      
    

  

      
        

  
          
        
          Governance, Risk & Compliance

      
      
          For responsible and transparent corporate governance, behaviour across all levels of the company must comply with statutory requirements. In addition, there must be a code of conduct for all those staff members representing stakeholder interests, e.g., shareholders, employees, customers, suppliers and investors. In this area of sustainability, the focus is primarily on a company adhering to mandatory statutory and sector-specific provisions and regulations, but also looks at how far other vital and, as a rule, self-regulatory ethical standards and requirements are met.

      
      

  

  
          
        
          Business

      
      
          In their core business, companies, as a matter of principle, ought to operate successfully in economic terms, yet also demonstrate social and ecological responsibility. Their products and services are to contribute to a sustainable development safeguarding the basis of life for future generations. Companies can demonstrate their responsible approach, an issue increasingly in the public eye, through such means as, for example, transparent cost management and an equitable pay structure.

      
      

  

  
          
        
          Environment

      
      
          This main area considers the environmental management of the participating companies. Environmental management is the section of organisational management concerned with operational and official environmental protection, i.e. with those business activities, products and services which impact the environment. In this area, the key indicators relate to cutting emissions, waste management and the safe treatment of hazardous substances.

      
      

  

  
          
        
          Society

      
      
          Sustainable companies think beyond their own immediate concerns and actively support society in their own surroundings. This main area focuses on a cross-section from a company’s smallest unit, e.g., promoting employee potential, to such universally accepted social values as anti-discrimination and diversity management or corporate involvement in civil society, e.g., donation policy.
