            Lakeside conferences, meetings in the green: Berlin's most beautiful locations for summer events

                      

                    

                              Without a doubt, we prefer to spend hot summer days... Outside! On the water, surrounded by green, or high above the city on a breezy rooftop terrace. So why not plan to hold your next meeting outdoors, maybe on a yacht or on an island? We've found some of the coolest event locations for hot days in Berlin.

 

Refreshingly different: waterside events

The 2C Spreequartier Berlin event location is part of the listed Spreespeicher located directly on the banks of the River Spree. You and up to 100 guests can enjoy the views from the large riverside terrace as the city passes you by. You'll catch sight of people paddling by while standing on surfboards and historic chimney stacks in the adjacent neighbourhoods home to Berlin's creative scene. In short, the perfect location for a summer event, Berlin-style. 

Further south, on the Neukölln shipping canal, is Germany 's largest hotel: Estrel Berlin. Together with the Estrel Congress Center, it offers 25,000 m² of event space, plus a large canal-side summer garden that's perfect for breaks to bask in the sun or take a quick boat ride.

Speaking of riding boats: a real insider tip for summer events is AMERON Hotel ABION Spreebogen. This 4-star hotel not only enjoys a direct location on the River Spree, it also offers its own yacht AIDA which can accommodate up to 20 people for exclusive events on the water. 


All in one boat

Build your team through shared activities. Invite your team to a boat tour on the River Spree or plan an outdoor incentive event. Berlin's summer locations on the water or surrounded by green are an ideal starting point for your planning.


 

Off to the islands! Give your event a holiday vibe

Whether you're planning a kick-off meeting, an incentive, or a company celebration, an event on an island gets that instant holiday feeling. And there are plenty to choose from in Berlin: Bridge Studios Berlin is found on a peninsula not far from the central Berlin. With a 3,500 m² park, a 35 m dock, and 900 m² courtyard, this former bridge repair shop is a grand spot for a summer party. 

You can also head to what is probably one of the most extraordinary locations in Berlin by water or via two historic railway bridges: event island on a 14 hectare (35 acre) island in the Havel. This green oasis with four studios and 5,000 m² of event space offers so many possibilities. Whatever you're planning, we recommend heading off to the islands!

Breath-taking views with open air meetings high over Berlin

On hot days, it's good just to get high up above the city and take a deep breath. An event location with a rooftop terrace will do just fine. For example, the rooftop at 25hours Hotel Bikini Berlin offers views from ten storeys up over City West and the zoo. The Monkey Bar and the restaurant NENI Berlin can hold up to 400 guests for special events against the wild backdrop of Berlin Zoo. 

High over Potsdamer Platz, Premium Offices offers another refreshingly different location for open air meetings. Up to 170 people can be hosted on its sunny terrace. Our summer favourite for green meetings is Tagungswerk, which features integrated environmental technology power by solar power and a 140 m² rooftop terrace with views over trendy Kreuzberg.

Meetings surrounded by green

Believe it or not, yes, almost everything's green in Berlin in Europe's greenest metropolis, there are countless outdoor spaces that could work for your next event. For example, how about having your next event at idyllic Biesdorf Palace, complete with a garden foyer and a terrace with views of the picturesque palace grounds. A setting fit for royalty, and not just in summer. 

SPSG Berlin-Brandenburg manages the many palaces and palace gardens in and around Berlin, once the capital of Prussia and the German Empire. So make your guests' fairy-tale dreams come true by hiring any number of magnificent palaces and orangeries for a day or night of being treated like noblemen and women.

                We are brilliantly connected - both (inter)nationally and regionally with a unique partner network.
              
                                      
                
                We are engaged free of charge because we act for you by order of the city.
              
                                      
                
                We are neutral because we represent the entire offerings of Berlin.
