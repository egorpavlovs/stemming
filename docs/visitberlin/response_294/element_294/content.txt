            Events in Winter: Top Locations in Berlin

                      

                    

                            

          


          
          The doors open, your guests enter and are immediately thrilled by the cosy atmosphere – and what better start could you have for your next winter event? Here, we are presenting various locations especially suited for events in the cold months of the year.

        
      
    

  

      
        Meeting around the fireplace in the Hotel Oderberger: Cosy and warm

    
  

  


          
          With its spreading 100-square-metre bar complete with comfy sofas and an open fire, the hotel and converted historical baths on GLS Campus Berlin offer an ideal winter location. In the bar, your guests can enjoy the lounge atmosphere and warm drinks, while the adjacent restaurant provides hearty German cuisine guaranteed to keep the cold at bay. This heritage building is ranked among Berlin’s most impressive event locations, with the cathedral-like pool hall now providing conference facilities for up to 650 guests. Other rooms are also available for large and small events. The library and the converted changing rooms are especially cosy in winter.

        Events in the Dalí Museum and Radisson Blu Hotel: A touch of the south

    
  

  


          
          When the cold and grey winter days never seem to end, thoughts inevitably turn to warm Mediterranean light and tropical heat. And you can find the right locations for both of those in Berlin’s conference and meetings landscape! Invite your guests to Dalí – The Exhibition at Potsdamer Platz, and let around 450 surrealist art works by this great Spanish artist inspire new creative ideas in your meetings. And in the Radisson Blu Hotel near Alexanderplatz square, your guests can enjoy the South Seas feeling. Apart from the hotel’s 15 state-of-the-art conference and meeting rooms covering a total of 2740 m², the lobby is remarkable for its AquaDom – the world’s largest, free-standing cylindrical aquarium with over 1500 fish from oceans around the globe!

        
      
    

  

      
        The Grand: Cool outside – cool inside 

    
  

  


          
          The next location we recommend for meetings and events in winter can also be found close to Alexanderplatz square – The Grand. This venue is one of the ‘coolest’ across Berlin. Neither rough nor classy, but shabby chic with a mix of cracked facades and elegance, the hotel has an immediate appeal for events. The unplastered brick walls, heavy crystal chandeliers and furnishings often combining individual pieces create the perfect atmosphere for special events with a bohemian flair.

        
      
    

  

      
        The Great Orangery: Baroque splendour and rooms flooded with light

        Große Orangerie des Schloss Charlottenburg

    
  

      
    

  


          
          The Great Orangery of Charlottenburg Palace is especially charming in winter. From the magnificent Orangery Hall to the West and East Wing with their floor-length banks of windows, this impressive historical setting is ideal for festive banquets, concerts and stylish receptions. Above all, the Orangery has a special atmosphere in winter when the splendid baroque palace contrasts with the wintery gardens and park. As soon as twilight falls on winter afternoons, the brightly lit rooms make a spectacular impression on guests.

                We are brilliantly connected - both (inter)nationally and regionally with a unique partner network.
              
                                      
                
                We are engaged free of charge because we act for you by order of the city.
              
                                      
                
                We are neutral because we represent the entire offerings of Berlin.
