            Berlin’s congress and trade fair highlights in 2019

                      

                    

                            

          


          
          If Berlin was a person, it would be someone you’d happily turn to for advice. Somebody with the best tips, who always knows someone who knows someone, and can help out with all those important questions in life. For example, suppose you wanted to become a travel expert, but weren’t sure how to gain an insight into the tourism sector.

Berlin would promptly urge you to visit the ITB Berlin (6-10 March), sketch the advantages of attending the Travel Festival (8-10 March) and most likely expand your list with the Brandenburgischer Reisemarkt fair for tourism in Brandenburg (6 April).

          Another example – something we’re all familiar with. You are a genuine foodie and would love to discover some new culinary delights. No sooner said than done. Berlin would whisk you off to the Fruit Logistica (6-8 February), accompany you to the WEINmesse (15-17 February), the largest wine fair of its kind in Germany, and chat with you about the latest and hottest trends at the last International Green Week (15-24 January). In brief, a year with Berlin at congresses, conferences and fairs and you’ll be more than up to speed on the tourism and travel sector!

        
      
    

  

      
        Food and drink

    
  

  


          
          Only because it was just mentioned – when it comes to topics related to food and drink, Berlin has a number of congress highlights to choose from. Aside from visiting the major fairs in this area, foodies and food sector specialists can also indulge their passion for the good things in life at a series of smaller must-visit events such as the Rohvolution (23-24 March) or VeggieWorld (30-31 March). Our tip: Remember to add the World of Coffee to the list. In 2019, this leading event for coffee specialists is held from 6-8 June at Messe Berlin. And far from being a niche affair, the World of Coffee is expected to attract close to 10,000 participants!

        
      
    

  

      
        Medicine and health

    
  

  


          
          Well-being and sports are very much a part of life in Berlin – as is evident from the sports, health and lifestyle fair open to the public held no less than twice a year at the former Tempelhof Airport. With over 100 exhibitors, Berlin Vital Spring (5-6 April) and its companion fair Berlin Vital Autumn (26-28 September) are the place to be for runners and all those interested in sports. Many fairs and congresses also address the full spectrum of issues around health, from spiritual approaches and alternative medicine at the Spiritualität & Heilen fair in February (15-17) to the numerous pharmaceutical, medical and scientific congresses across the year. This sector leads the rankings in the Berlin congress market with a share of 20 per cent, so whatever the season the city is a key meeting point for a global audience of health experts, physicians, biologists and pharmacologists. These medical congresses range, for instance, from the Congress of Capital Medicine and Health (May 21-23) to the World Congress of the European Association for Palliative Care (23-25 May) and the Diabetes Congress in the CityCube (29 May-1 June) to the World Congress of Behaviour and Cognitive Therapy (17-20 July) and the 11th World Health Summit (27-29 October).

        Culture and the media

    
  

  


          
          Who could be better acquainted with the arts, culture and communication than Berlin? With the city’s familiarity with these sectors, it’s hardly surprising that it is home to such events as the Bel Canto Symposium (9 February) on the synthesis of tonal beauty, expression and virtuosity, the A MAZE international festival (10-14 April) spotlighting the art and culture of games and playful media or the “Fontane’s Media 1819 – 2019” International Congress (13-16 June). The city has always attracted great thinkers, scholars and scientists, just as it still does – for instance at the III International Conference on Social Sciences and the Humanities from 2-5 May. No doubt all these events will be the subject of media coverage – and you can find out about other topics in world debate and how they are presented at the Kommunikationskongress 2019 in the bcc, one of the leading specialist congresses for media spokespeople, PR, press and communication officers in Germany (12-13 September).

        
      
    

  

      
        Digital advances

    
  

  


          
          For a long time, culture and communication today has no longer been just about traditional forms of media. At the re:publica (6-8 May), one of the world’s leading events of the digital society, over 500 speakers from more than 40 countries come to Berlin to present the latest trends and issues in the areas of the internet, media, culture, politics, technology and science. International visitors and exhibitors are also in Berlin to check out the latest developments in the IT world presented at the relaunch Conference (11 February), the E-commerce Expo (20 February) and the Media Convention Berlin (6-8 May) organised by the Berlin-Brandenburg Medienboard.

        Science and technology

    
  

  


          
          Digital trends are now the norm in all sectors, but technology and science in particular are inconceivable without them. In a series of fairs and events, Berlin offers an insight into the future of mobility, power supply systems, the administration and industry. For instance, you could begin at the Zukünftiges Stromnetz (30-31 January), a conference dedicated to smart energy grids, before moving on to the VDA Technical Congress (14-15 March) and the 21st Future of Energy Industry (26-27 March) – and that’s just for starters. The Electric Vehicles Europe (10-11 April) focuses on future mobility while Wearable Europe Berlin (10-11 April) presents future fashions. In late May, experts gather at the 7th Zukunftskongress Staat & Verwaltung (27-29 May) to discuss e-government and modernising administrations. And last but not least, from 6-11 September, the public will be flocking to the IFA Consumer Electronics trade fair, hosted by Berlin since 1924, making it one of the city’s oldest industrial fairs.
