Berlin Essentials

If you are new to Berlin, the best place to start exploring the city is the government quarter, strolling from the Reichstag parliament building through the Brandenburg Gate, down the Unter den Linden boulevard to the TV Tower.

Discovering Berlin's museums

If you are interested in art and archaeology, then Berlin’s legendary Museum Island near Alexanderplatz is an absolute must. At this remarkable UNESCO World Heritage Site, you can marvel at such world treasures as the bust of Nefertiti, the impressive Ishtar Gate and Processional Way, and the fascinating Roman Market Gate of Miletus. Contemporary art aficionados can be found checking out the Berlinische Galerie, the Hamburger Bahnhof museum and the city’s wealth of art galleries.

Berlin's green spaces

Berlin not only has a street vibe envied the world over, but also over 2500 green oases where city dwellers and visitors can leave the bustling city behind. As the urban beat fades when you stroll through the spreading Grunewald forest, explore the Gardens of the World in Berlin Marzahn, visit the waterfall in the inner city Victoria Park or take a boat tour on Müggelsee lake, it’s easy to forget that Berlin is such a vibrant metropolis, home to over 3.5 million people. But if you prefer wide open spaces and an even wider horizon close to the heart of the city, then check out the park on the site of the former Tempelhof Airport!

Locations of world history

In Berlin, you can find the traces of history everywhere in the city. Berlin has many memorial sites commemorating the First and Second World War and the division of Germany after 1945. Frankfurter Allee, for instance, also offers a fascinating example of East German architecture. The former airport at the Tempelhofer Feld also played a crucial part in the city’s history. At times during the Berlin blockade, the supply planes, nicknamed the ‘Candy Bombers’, were landing and taking off every 90 seconds!

                We are brilliantly connected - both (inter)nationally and regionally with a unique partner network.
              
                                      
                
                We are engaged free of charge because we act for you by order of the city.
              
                                      
                
                We are neutral because we represent the entire offerings of Berlin.
