          Information about the collection of personal data and contact details

We are pleased that you are visiting our website www.convention.visitberlin.de and thank you for your interest. In the following we will inform you about the handling of your personal data when you use our website. Personal data are all data that allow you to be personally identified.

The controller within the meaning of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) responsible for data processing on this website is:

Berlin Tourismus & Kongress GmbH
Am Karlsbad 11
D-10785 Berlin

Tel: +49 (0)30 25 00 23 33  Fax: +49 (0)30 25 00 24 24 Email: info@visitBerlin.de

The controller responsible for the processing of personal data is the natural or legal person who, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.

The controller has appointed a data protection officer for this website, who can be contacted as follows:

        Data collection when you visit our website

    
  

  


          
          When you use our website for information purposes only, i.e. if you do not register or otherwise provide us with information, we only collect data that your browser transmits to our server (so-called "server log files"). When you call up our website, we collect the following data that are technically necessary for us to display the website to you:

- our website which was visited
- date and time of access
- volume of data sent, in byte
- source/link from which you accessed the page
- browser used
- operating system used
- IP address used (in some cases: made anonymous)

Processing is carried out in accordance with Art. 6 (1) letter f GDPR on the basis of our legitimate interest in improving the stability and functionality of our website. The data will not be passed on or used in any other way. However, we reserve the right to check the server log files at a later date if there are any concrete indications of illegal use.

        
      
    

  

      
        Cookies

    
  

  


          
          In order to make visits to our website more attractive and to enable the use of certain functions, we use so-called cookies on various pages. These are small text files that are stored on your end device. Some of the cookies we use are deleted after the end of the browser session, i.e. after you close your browser (so-called session cookies). Other cookies remain on your end device and enable us or our partner companies (cookies from third parties) to recognise your browser on your next visit (persistent cookies). If cookies are set, they collect and process specific user information such as browser and location data as well as IP address values to varying degrees. Persistent cookies are automatically deleted after a specified period, which may vary depending on the cookie. In some cases, cookies are used to simplify the ordering process by saving settings (e.g. remembering the contents of a virtual shopping basket for a later visit to the website). If personal data are also processed by individual cookies implemented by us, the processing is carried out in accordance with Art. 6 (1) letter b GDPR either for the execution of the contract or in accordance with Art. 6 (1) letter f GDPR in order to safeguard our legitimate interest in the website's best possible functionality and a customer-friendly and effective design of the visit to the site.

We may work with advertising partners to help us make our website more interesting for you. To this end, cookies from partner companies (third-party cookies) will also be stored on your hard disk in this case when you visit our website. When we cooperate with the aforementioned advertising partners, you will be informed individually and separately about the use of such cookies and the extent of the information collected in each case in the following paragraphs.

Please note that you can set your browser in such a way that you are informed about the setting of cookies and can decide individually about their acceptance, or exclude the acceptance of cookies in certain cases or in general. Each browser is different in the way it manages the cookie settings. This is described in the help menu of each browser, which explains how you can change your cookie settings. You will find such information for the respective browsers under the following links:

        Contacting us

    
  

  


          
          When you contact us (e.g. via contact form or email), personal data are collected. Which data are collected when using a contact form can be seen on the respective form. These data are stored and used exclusively for the purpose of responding to your request and establishing contact, and for the ensuing technical administration. The legal basis for the processing of the data is our justified interest in responding to your enquiry pursuant to Art. 6 (1) letter f GDPR. If the purpose of your contacting us is to conclude a contract, then an additional legal basis for the processing is Art. 6 (1) letter b GDPR. Your data will be deleted after final processing of your enquiry; this is the case if it can be inferred from the circumstances that the facts in question have been conclusively clarified and if there are no legal retention obligations to the contrary.

        
      
    

  

      
        Registration in partner portal or forum

    
  

  


          
          You can register on our website specifying certain personal data. Which personal data are processed for the purpose of registration can be seen from the input mask used for registration. For registration we use the so-called double opt-in procedure, i.e. your registration is not complete until you have confirmed your registration by clicking on the link contained in a confirmation email sent to you for this purpose. If you do not confirm within 24 hours, your registration will automatically be deleted from our database. Provision of the aforementioned data is obligatory; all further information may be provided voluntarily through the use of our portal. When you use our portal, we store the data required to fulfil the contract, including information on the method of payment, until you permanently terminate your access. Furthermore, we store the data you have voluntarily provided for the duration of your use of the portal, unless you delete it beforehand. You can manage and change all your data in the protected customer area. The legal basis is Art. 6 (1) letter f GDPR.

In addition, we store all content published by you (such as public contributions, bulletin board entries, guestbook entries, etc.) for the operation of the website. Provision of the website with its complete user-generated content is in our legitimate interest; the legal basis for this is Art. 6 (1) letter f GDPR. When you delete your account, your public statements will remain visible to all readers, especially in the forum, but your account will no longer be accessible. All other data will be deleted in this case.

        
      
    

  

      
        Comments function

    
  

  


          
          With the comments function on this website, apart from your comments, details on the time of writing the comment and the commentator name you have chosen will be stored and published on the website. Furthermore, your IP address will be logged and stored. Such storage of the IP address is done for security reasons and in case the data subject violates the rights of third parties or posts illegal content in a comment. We require your email address in order to contact you in the unlikely event that a third party should object to your published content as being unlawful. The legal basis for the storage of your data is Art. 6 (1) letters b and f GDPR. We reserve the right to delete comments if they are objected to as being unlawful by third parties.

        
      
    

  

      
        Use of your data for direct advertising

    
  

  


          
          Subscription to our email newsletter

If you subscribe to our email newsletter, we will send you regular information about our offers. The only mandatory information we need to send you the newsletter is your email address. Any other data you provide is voluntary and will be used to address you personally. For the dispatch of the newsletter, we use the so-called double opt-in procedure. This means that we will not send you an email newsletter unless you have expressly confirmed to us that you agree to the sending of the newsletter. We will send you a confirmation email asking you to confirm that you wish to receive newsletters in the future by clicking on the relevant link.

By activating the confirmation link, you give us your consent to the use of your personal data in accordance with Art. 6 (1) letter a GDPR. When you subscribe to the newsletter, we store your IP address entered by the Internet Service Provider (ISP) as well as the date and time of subscription in order to be able to trace any possible misuse of your email address at a later date. The data collected by us when you subscribe to the newsletter will only be used for advertising purposes in the newsletter.

You can unsubscribe from the newsletter any time via the link provided in the newsletter or by notifying the responsible person named above. After unsubscribing, your email address will immediately be deleted from our newsletter mailing list, unless you have expressly consented to further use of your data or we have reserved the right to use data beyond this, as permitted by law, and about which we inform you in this declaration.

Newsletter tracking 

Our newsletters contain so-called tracking pixels. A tracking pixel is a miniature graphic embedded in emails which are sent in HTML format to allow log files to be recorded and analysed. This allows a statistical evaluation of the success or failure of online marketing campaigns. 

We only carry out anonymous link-tracking (count-tracking). The hereby collected usage data, e.g. opening and click reactions, serve statistical purposes and are not passed on to third parties or used for purposes other than those mentioned here. No data are collected that can be attributed to the recipient. All the recipients of a newsletter are only evaluated together.

Advertising by letter mail

Based on our legitimate interest in personalised direct advertising, we reserve the right to store your first and last name, your postal address and – if we have received these additional details from you within the framework of our contractual relationship – your title, academic degree, year of birth and professional, industrial or business name in accordance with Art. 6 (1) letter f GDPR and to use this information to send you interesting offers and information on our products by letter post. You can object to the storage and use of your data for this purpose at any time by notifying the controller to this effect.

        
      
    

  

      
        Passing on of personal data to third parties

    
  

  


          
          The personal data collected by us will be passed on to the haulier commissioned with the delivery of goods, the tourist service provider (e.g. the hotel), or the transport company commissioned to carry out a trip, as part of contract fulfilment, insofar as this is necessary to deliver goods, carry out a procured hotel booking or carry out a package trip. During the settlement of legal transactions, we pass on your payment data to the credit institution or payment service provider commissioned to process the payment.

Third parties involved in the implementation and performance of the contract may only process and use your data to execute the order and fulfil the contract. Such third parties are also entitled to create pseudonymous user profiles with the aid of cookies and IP addresses in order to send personalised advertisements to the individual user and/or to use the data for market research purposes. Pseudonymised data, e.g. about website visitors or bookings with travel recommendation portals, are also exchanged via these cookies for range analysis. The partners named below are in the main so-called ad server operators, travel recommendation portals and web analysis providers. visitBerlin currently cooperates with the partners Google, DoubleClick, nugg.ad, TripAdvisor and etracker in this field. The processing and use of such data is therefore subject to the data protection rules of the respective partner.

You can find out which personal data of yours we store and transmit to third parties at any time and withdraw your consent. To do so, please direct your request to the address/email stated under "Information on Customer Rights and Contact Details". If you wish to object to the processing and use of the data by the ad server operators, then you must declare your revocation to the respective partner. To do so, please open the respective link as described below under "Opt-Out".

Apart from that your personal data will not be transmitted to third parties, unless we are obliged to do so by law or a relevant court or official order in exceptional cases. Should you receive advertising from Berlin Tourismus & Kongress GmbH or its cooperating partners despite a declared revocation, please contact us without delay. In this case, please notify the contact indicated at the bottom of the website.

When you access a page of our website that contains such a plug-in, your browser establishes a direct connection to the servers of Facebook, Twitter, Google or Pinterest. The relevant provider will transmit the content of the plug-in directly to your browser and integrate it into the page. Through this integration, the providers will receive the information that your browser has called up the corresponding page of our website, even if you do not have a profile with the social network in question or are not currently logged in. This information (including your IP address) is transmitted directly from your browser to a server of the relevant provider in the USA and stored there. If you are logged in to one of the social networks, the providers can directly map your visit to our website to your profile on Facebook, Twitter, Google+ or Pinterest. If you interact with the plug-ins, e.g. by pressing the "Like" or "+1" button, this information will also be transmitted directly to a server of the providers and stored there. The information will also be published on the social network and shown to your contacts. The purpose and extent of the data collection and the further processing and use of the data by the providers as well as your rights in this regard and the setting options for the protection of your privacy can be found in the privacy notices supplied by the providers.

          Use of Vimeo videos

Our website includes plug-ins of the video portal Vimeo belonging to Vimeo, LLC, 555 West 18th Street, New York, New York 10011, USA. When you access a page of our website that contains such a plug-in, your browser establishes a direct connection to Vimeo's servers. Vimeo transmits the content of the plug-in directly to your browser and integrates it into the page. Through this integration, Vimeo receives the information that your browser has called up the corresponding page of our website, even if you do not have a Vimeo account or are not currently logged in to Vimeo. This information (including your IP address) is transmitted directly from your browser to a Vimeo server in the USA and stored there.

If you are logged in to Vimeo, Vimeo can immediately allocate your visit to our website to your Vimeo account. If you interact with the plug-ins (e.g. by pressing the start button of a video), this information is also transmitted directly to a Vimeo server and stored there. The described data processing steps take place in accordance with Art. 6 (1) letter f GDPR on the basis of Vimeo's legitimate interest in market research and designing their service in line with user needs. If you do not wish Vimeo to map the data collected via our website directly to your Vimeo account, you need to log out of Vimeo before visiting our website. The purpose and extent of the data collection and the further processing and use of the data by Vimeo as well as your rights in this regard and the setting options for the protection of your privacy can be found in the privacy notice supplied by Vimeo:

http://vimeo.com/privacy

In the case of Vimeo videos that are included on our site, the tracking tool Google Analytics is automatically integrated. This is Vimeo's own tracking system, to which we have no access and over which we have no control. For tracking purposes, Google Analytics uses so-called "cookies", i.e. text files which are saved on your computer and allow an analysis of your use of the website. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website is generally transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there.

Such processing is carried out in accordance with Art. 6 (1) letter f GDPR on the basis of Vimeo's legitimate interest in statistical analysis of user behaviour for purposes of optimisation and marketing.

Use of YouTube videos

This website uses the YouTube embedding function for the display and playing of videos of the provider "YouTube", which belongs to Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA ("Google"). For this, the extended data protection mode is applied, which, according to the provider, only starts to store user data when the video(s) is/are played. When the playback of embedded YouTube videos is started, the provider uses "YouTube" cookies to collect data on user behaviour, which, according to "YouTube", serve among other things to collect video statistics, improve user-friendliness and prevent unlawful actions. When you are logged in to Google, your data will be directly mapped to your account when you click on a video. If you want to avoid this mapping to your profile on YouTube, you need to log out before activating the button. Google saves your data (even for users who are not logged in) as usage profiles and evaluates them. Such evaluation is carried out in particular pursuant to Art. 6 (1) letter f GDPR on the basis of Google's legitimate interests in the insertion of personalised advertising, market research and/or demand-oriented design of its website. You have the right to object to the creation of these user profiles; to do so, you need to contact YouTube. Regardless of whether the embedded videos are played back, every time this website is accessed a connection to the Google network "DoubleClick" is established, which could trigger further data processing operations without our influence. Google LLC, based in the USA, is certified for the US-European data protection agreement "Privacy Shield", which guarantees adherence to the data protection standards applicable in the EU.

You will find further information on YouTube's data protection in the

provider's privacy statement under:

          DoubleClick by Google

This website uses the online marketing tool DoubleClick by Google belonging to Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA ("Google"). DoubleClick uses cookies to display user-relevant advertisements, improve campaign performance reports, or prevent a user from seeing the same advertisement several times. By means of a cookie ID, Google records which advertisements are displayed in which browser and can thus prevent them from being displayed repeatedly. Processing is carried out on the basis of our legitimate interest in the optimal marketing of our website in accordance with Art. 6 (1) letter f GDPR. In addition, DoubleClick may use cookie IDs to record so-called conversions which relate to advertising requests. This is the case, for example, when a user sees a DoubleClick ad and later visits the advertiser's website with the same browser and buys something there. According to Google, DoubleClick cookies do not carry any personal information. Because of the marketing tools used, your browser automatically establishes a direct connection to the Google server. We have no influence on the extent and further usage of the data collected by Google by means of this tool and will therefore advise you as follows to the best of our knowledge: Through the integration of DoubleClick, Google receives the information that you have called up the relevant part of our Internet website or clicked on an advertisement of ours. If you are registered with a Google service, Google can map your visit to your account. Even if you are not registered with Google or are not logged in, there is a possibility of your IP address being obtained and stored by the provider.

If you wish to opt out of this tracking process, you can disable cookies for conversion tracking by setting your browser to block cookies from the www.googleadservices.com domain, https://www.google.com/settings/ads; this setting will be cancelled if you delete your cookies. Alternatively, you can obtain information about the setting of cookies from the Digital Advertising Alliance at the Internet address www.aboutads.info and make the desired adjustments. Finally, you can set your browser in such a way that you are informed about the setting of cookies and can decide individually about their acceptance, or exclude the acceptance of cookies in certain cases or in general. Please note that the functionality of our website may be restricted if cookies are not accepted.

Google LLC, based in the USA, is certified for the US-European data protection agreement "Privacy Shield", which guarantees adherence to the data protection standards applicable in the EU. You can find more information about DoubleClick by Google's data protection provisions by going to:

Google AdSense

This website uses Google AdSense, a web advertising service of Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA ("Google"). Google AdSense uses so-called "DoubleClick DART Cookies" ("cookies"). These are text files which are saved on your computer and allow an analysis of your use of the

website. Furthermore, to collect information Google AdSense also uses so-called "web beacons" (small, invisible graphics), which can be used to record, collect and evaluate simple actions such as visitor traffic on the website. The information (including your IP address) generated by the cookie and/or web beacon about your use of this website is generally transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there.

Google uses the information thus obtained to evaluate your usage behaviour as regards AdSense advertisements. The IP address transmitted by your browser in connection with Google AdSense will not be combined with other Google data. The information collected by Google may possibly be transferred to third parties if this is required by law and/or if third parties process this data on behalf of Google.

The described processing of data is performed pursuant to Art. 6 (1) letter f GDPR for the purpose of targeted solicitation of the user by advertising third parties whose advertisements are displayed on this website on the basis of the evaluated user behaviour. At the same time, the processing serves our financial interest in exploiting the economic potential of our Internet website by displaying personalised third-party advertising content for a fee.

Google LLC, based in the USA, is certified for the US-European data protection agreement "Privacy Shield", which guarantees adherence to the data protection standards applicable in the EU. You can find more information about Google's data protection provisions by going to: http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/. You can permanently disable the setting of cookies for advertising preferences by preventing them with the appropriate setting of your browser software or by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available via the following link:

Use of Google AdWords conversion tracking

This website uses the online ad programme "Google AdWords" and, within Google AdWords, the conversion tracking of Google LLC., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA ("Google"). We use Google AdWords to draw attention to our attractive offers with the aid of advertising means (so-called Google AdWords) on external websites. We can determine how successful individual advertising measures are based on the data from the advertising campaigns. We thus pursue our aim of showing you advertisements that are of interest to you, making our website more interesting for you and achieving a fair calculation of advertising costs. The conversion tracking cookie is set when a user clicks on an AdWords ad published by Google. Cookies are small text files that are stored in your computer system. As a rule, these cookies expire after 30 days and are not used for personal identification. If the user visits certain pages of this website before the cookie expires, we and Google can see that the user has clicked on the ad and was redirected to this page. Each Google AdWords customer receives a different cookie. Cookies therefore cannot be traced through the websites of AdWords customers. The information collected by means of the conversion cookie is used to compile conversion statistics for AdWords customers who have chosen to use conversion tracking. Customers are informed of the total number of users that clicked on their advertisement and were redirected to a page containing a conversion tracking tag. They do not, however, receive any information with which users can be personally identified. If you do not wish to be tracked, you can block this use by disabling the cookie for Google conversion tracking via your Internet browser under User Settings. You will then not be included in the conversion tracking statistics. We use Google AdWords on the grounds of our legitimate interest in targeted advertising pursuant to Art. 6 (1) letter f GDPR.  Google LLC, based in the USA, is certified for the US-European data protection agreement "Privacy Shield", which guarantees adherence to the data protection standards applicable in the EU.

Google Maps is a web service for displaying interactive (country) maps in order to visually provide geographical information. You can use this service to see our location and make it easier for you to find us. When you access sub-pages that incorporate a Google Maps map, information about your use of our website (such as your IP address) is transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. This is the case regardless of whether Google provides a user account that you are logged in to or whether no user account exists. When you are logged in to Google, your data will be directly mapped to your account. If you want to avoid this mapping to your profile at Google, you need to log out before activating the button. Google saves your data (even for users who are not logged in) as usage profiles and evaluates them. Such evaluation is carried out in particular pursuant to Art. 6 (1) letter f GDPR on the basis of Google's legitimate interests in the insertion of personalised advertising, market research and/or demand-oriented design of its website. You have the right to object to the creation of these user profiles; to do so, you need to contact Google.

        Rights of the data subject

    
  

  


          
          The current data protection law grants you comprehensive data subject rights (rights of access and intervention) as regards the processing of your personal data vis-à-vis the controller, about which we inform you below:

- Right of access pursuant to Art. 15 GDPR:

In particular, you have a right to information about your personal data processed by us, the purposes of the processing, the categories of the personal data processed, the recipients or categories of recipients to whom your data have been or will be disclosed, the envisaged storage period or the criteria for determining the storage period, the existence of a right to rectification, erasure, restriction of processing or objection to the processing, of a right to complain to a supervisory authority, about the source of your data, if these were not collected from you by us, the existence of automated decision-making including profiling and, if required, meaningful information about the logic involved and the extent to which you are concerned and the envisaged consequences of such processing, as well as your right to be informed of any safeguards which exist pursuant to Art. 46 GDPR in the event of the transfer of your data to third countries;

- Right to rectification pursuant to Art. 16 GDPR:

You have a right to immediate rectification of any inaccurate data concerning you and/or completion of any incomplete data concerning you stored by us;

- Right to erasure pursuant to Art. 17 GDPR:

You have the right to demand the erasure of your personal data if the requirements of Art. 17 (1) GDPR are met. This right does not, however, exist especially if the processing is necessary for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information, for compliance with a legal obligation, for reasons of public interest or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims;

- Right to restriction of processing pursuant to Art. 18 GDPR:

You have the right to demand the restriction of the processing of your personal data for as long as the contested accuracy of your data is being verified, or if the processing is unlawful and you oppose the erasure of your data and instead request the restriction of their use, or if we are no longer in need of this data for the purposes of the processing but you require your data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, or if you have filed an objection on grounds relating to your particular situation, for as long as it is not yet clear whether our legitimate reasons prevail;

- Right to information pursuant to Art. 19 GDPR:

If you have exercised your right to have the data controller rectify or erase your personal data or restrict the processing, he shall be obliged to inform all recipients to whom the personal data concerning you have been disclosed of this rectification or erasure of the data or restriction of processing, unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort. You have the right to be informed of these recipients;

- Right to data portability pursuant to Art. 20 GDPR:

You have the right to receive the personal data you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format or to demand their transfer to another controller, where technically feasible;

- Right of withdrawal of consent pursuant to Art. 7 (3) GDPR:

You have the right to withdraw your consent to the processing of data at any time with effect for the future. In the event of withdrawal we will delete the relevant data without delay, unless further processing can take place on a legal basis which allows processing without consent. The withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of the processing carried out on the basis of the consent up to the withdrawal;

- Right to complain pursuant to Art. 77 GDPR:

If you believe that the processing of personal data concerning you infringes the GDPR, you have the right to complain to a supervisory authority, in particular in the member state where you reside or work or the place where the alleged infringement occurred, without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy;

        RIGHT OF OBJECTION

    
  

  


          
          If, in the course of balancing interests, we should process your personal data on the basis of our overriding legitimate interest, you will have the right to object at any time to this processing with future effect on grounds relating to your particular situation. If you exercise your right of objection, we will stop processing the data concerned. However, we reserve the right to continue processing if we can prove that there are compelling reasons worthy of protection for the processing, which override your interests, fundamental rights and freedoms, or if the processing serves the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. If we process your personal data for direct advertising purposes, you will have the right to object at any time to the processing of personal data concerning you for such advertising purposes.

The duration of the storage of personal data is determined by the respective statutory retention period (e.g. commercial and fiscal retention periods). For accounting documents, for example, this is 10 years and for business documents that are the subject of a contract, as a rule 6 years. Upon expiry of each specific period, the relevant data will routinely be deleted, provided that they are no longer necessary for the fulfilment or initiation of the contract and/or there is no longer any legitimate interest on our part in further storage.
