            A real wow factor! – The superlatives of Berlin’s MICE sector

                      

                    

                            

          


          
          Right at the top, extra-special, eminently historical or at the highest level of excellence – Berlin’s locations and conference hotels regularly provide a wow factor in the event industry. With that certain something special, the capital’s top venues are rich in superlatives and offer event planners undreamt-of possibilities for extraordinary meetings, incentives, conferences and congresses. Be inspired to plan an event at the world’s oldest postal museum, in Germany’s highest building or in Berlin’s smartest district.

        
      
    

  

      
        Right at the very, very top: the highest event space in the city

    
  

  


          
          High, higher, TV tower. At a height of over 200 metres, the famous landmark at Alexanderplatz has been granted the undisputed superlative of being the highest location in Berlin – and in Germany! There is space for up to 200 guests on the viewing platform of the Berlin TV Tower – for meetings, incentives and events with a 360-degree panoramic view and a full rotation in the legendary sphere every hour. You will find another highlight of the Berlin congress landscape quite literally on Alexanderplatz: Park Inn by Radisson Berlin Alexanderplatz. With a total of eleven halls and event rooms and 1,012 rooms on 37 floors, it is the highest hotel in Berlin and the second highest in Germany.

The sky is also the limit for event organisers at Potsdamer Platz – with the fastest lift in Europe to the Panoramapunkt. At the Panoramacafé and on the outer terraces on the 24th and 25th floors there are 230 square metres of event space at a height of 103 metres catering for up to 500 people.

        
      
    

  
  



  
  
    
        


                


  
            




      

          


  
            




      

          


  
            




      

          


  
            




      

          
          
          
          
      

    
  



  

      
        Meetings with history: Extra-special historical locations

    
  

  


          
          In Berlin event planners can immerse themselves in the unique history of the capital everywhere they go and bestow extraordinary flair on their conferences and congresses. One example of this is Deutsche Telekom’s Representative Office, the largest and oldest preserved building from the dawn of the telecommunication age – ideal for conferences and political events for up to 1,200 people.

The Königliche Porzellan-Manufaktur Berlin (KPM), with its large courtyard, former kiln hall and historic Schlämmerei (porcelain preparation facility) on an area of over 3,000 square metres, is an inviting location for special events at Berlin's oldest industrial heritage site. The 150-year-old Hoppegarten Racecourse is the oldest and largest sports facility (in terms of surface area) in the capital. The 207-hectare site is one of the capital’s leading outdoor event venues.

          Furthermore, the Museum for Communication Berlin has international significance: Opened in 1898 as the Imperial Postal Museum, it is the oldest postal museum in the world and today offers up to 1,760 square metres of space in five event rooms for extraordinary events.

        
      
    

  

      
        Large, larger, Berlin: our largest venues

    
  

  


          
          Germany’s largest conference and congress hotel is – of course – in Berlin. With 1,125 rooms and suites, the Estrel Berlin four-star plus hotel is unequivocally among the superlatives of Germany’s hotel landscape. The adjacent Estrel Congress Center has 25,000 square metres of event space where event organisers can plan conferences and events for up to 12,000 visitors.

The event space of Berlin's CityCube is more than seven times larger. It has a direct connection to the trade fair grounds, over 150 rooms and 180,000 square metres of event space as well as a pillar-free hall for up to 5,000 guests in the multi-functional congress and trade fair arena.

The InterContinental hotel also regularly opens Berlin’s largest pillar-free ballroom in Berlin City West for events for up to 1,500 people.

        At the highest level of excellence: *****+

    
  

  


          
          And since we’re already talking about hotels and superlatives: Berlin’s star hotels have plenty to offer at the highest of all levels. In the five-star plus category, the stars are barely sufficient: These include the five-star superior hotel The Ritz Carlton, which has won numerous awards and has event facilities for up to 1,500 visitors. The Mandala in Berlin-Tegel, the Sofitel on the Ku’damm, the Waldorf Astoria in Charlottenburg and the Regent in Mitte are some of the other top-class conference and congress hotels in the city.

        
      
    

  

      
        An extraordinary distinction: superlatives à la Berlin

    
  

  


          
          In Berlin it is typical for some event spaces and locations to enjoy superlative status due to their uniqueness and for that reason alone they enjoy great popularity with event planners. For example, the EUREF Campus is unique in all of Europe. As a symbol of the energy revolution in Germany and a centre for innovative future-oriented projects, the location offers plenty of space for conferences and events for up to 600 people, against a backdrop of cool industrial architecture.

Presented with the Design Award 2018, the Brandenburg Gate Museum is also among the capital’s superlatives: with a 270-degree panoramic screen, the museum right at the Brandenburg Gate is the multimedia event location for up to 100 guests.

The Radisson Blu conference hotel is also unique. Not only does its free-standing, cylindrical aquarium (the largest in the world) make it an attractive place for events, the aquarium is also surrounded by 15 event and conference rooms, with a total area of 2,740 square metres.

Those who would prefer to hold a conference in the presence of dinosaurs rather than sharks will feel right at home at the Natural History Museum: The brachiosaurus brancai keeps watch in the dinosaur hall, towering 13.27 metres over all the event guests.

          Last but not least is Berlin’s “smartest address” for event planners: The Adlershof con.vent technology park has been one of Berlin's most important science, industry and media locations for over 100 years and is one of the 15 largest technology parks in the world.
