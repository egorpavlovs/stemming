          Synergy is good, but Übermut is better – just as visitBerlin and Hamburg Marketing are proving with their innovative Übermut project. Together with artists and creatives, these two cities are thinking outside the box to dare the unconventional and tap new possibilities. For example, in the USA where We Like America toured for six weeks with the raumlaborberlin artists and architects’ collective and the Spacebuster, a mobile urban activator. Raumlaborberlin’s Spacebuster truck quickly created a large inflatable space, providing an unusual stage for Germany’s cultural and creative scene, stimulating and strengthening dialogue. This project showed, once again, the power of innovative locations– and gained the Übermut project the Berlin Design Award in Gold.

        Berlin in the bubble: Übermut in America

    
  

  


  
    
            
          Funded by the German Federal Foreign Office, the remarkable Übermut Project launched by Berlin and Hamburg provides German artists and creatives with a chance to present themselves to a global audience. The project not only creates a space and infrastructure to support exchanges and networking, but also an international stage where a broad spectrum of artists and creatives can offer a direct insight into Germany’s creative potential and diverse event landscape. But how do you present special locations, edgy ideas, unusual spaces and innovative formats? Quite simply – for example, with a Spacebuster truck and a translucent inflatable ‘bubble’, just as in America last autumn.
For six weeks, the Berlin artists and architects’ collective raumlaborberlin took to the highway for an experimental road trip across the USA with the Spacebuster truck. On the We Like America tour, at stopovers from the Chicago Architecture Biennial to St. Louis and Cleveland and on to New York, the inflatable ‘superbubble’ provided German artists and creatives with a flexible stage. Wherever this seemingly ordinary vehicle stopped, it quickly created a large event space by pumping air into an inflatable membrane at the back of the truck. And everywhere this translucent balloon-like event space was inflated, it soon attracted an audience – and effectively promoted Berlin.

          Once inside the hand-sewn bubble, you are in another world, a new, remarkable space – and can look out at the ordinary world, blurred by the bubble’s milky, semi-translucent membrane. The bubble creates a flexible event space for concerts, lectures on architecture, film screenings or workshops. In this way, the Spacebuster bubble fuels an exchange between Berlin, key actors and local guests. In the USA, not only did local schools and colleges join in the programme, but so did renowned institutions in the vicinity, including project partners such as the Storefront for Art and Architecture and the Pulitzer Arts Foundation. Hardly one month after the tour ended, the Spacebuster and the We Like America tour even won gold at the Berlin Design Awards in the Pop-Ups, Display, Exhibit & Set Design category.

          Thanks to the positive resonance to the Spacebuster’s We Like America tour, the Übermut Project is now ready to explore other continents and the creative spaces in other countries. After stops in America in 2017, as well as Milan, Hong Kong, Brighton, Paris, Amsterdam, Teheran and Bangkok, visits are already scheduled to other cities in the USA and South America in 2018, with new projects planned in Los Angeles and Buenos Aires. Here, the Übermut team meets the local creative scene to further develop networks and ideas, and grow the fascination with Berlin and Hamburg.
