            10 cool Conventions! Berlins truly unusual meetings and conferences in 2018

                      

                    

                            

          


          
          Colourful and diverse – Berlin is a city where writers and poets feel at home just as much as Japanese artists, naturopaths, or planetary researchers. No matter what your interests, they have their niche in Berlin – and their own dedicated convention or congress held in an appropriate location. In 2018, Berlin’s MICE sector can enjoy over 200 events, but we are especially looking forward to these 10 meetings and conventions!

        
      
    

  

      
        1 Berlin Mould Conference

    
  

  


          
          Mould conference? Yes, that’s right – Berlin is hosting the Mould Conference, a forum for experts in the sector. But before leaping up to check the food in your fridge, this is a different mould. Rather than for the food industry, this conference is for professionals and specialists working in construction and real estate. Here, everyone from architects to civil engineers, decorators and practitioners of environmental medicine can find all the latest developments in diagnosing, treating and preventing mould in buildings.

          Berlin is a magnet for foodies and a trailblazer in trends in healthy nutrition. So it’s hardly surprising that Germany’s congress capital is hosting the Rohvolution. A fixed date in the calendar for organic raw food fans, this conference is a chance to join forces for two days to explore and exchange news and views on the advantages of a raw food diet.

Raw food is defined as food as fresh as possible, never heated above 42° C or cooled below 0° C. For the aficionados of a raw food diet, this ensures all the natural vitamins and nutrients so vital for our sense of wellbeing and a positive, healthy lifestyle.

        7 Paperless Pioneers Conference

    
  

  


          
          Paper, paper, everywhere! Covering your desk, rustling around meetings and – worst of all – blocking the photocopier. So, what would the world of work look like without paper? Would it really be more environmentally-friendly? And crucially, is it just a utopian dream? At the Paperless Pioneers Conference in Berlin, paperless office visionaries, dreamers, theorists and experts join forces to spotlight paperless solutions for business – and also show how these strategies could be applied to the private sphere.
