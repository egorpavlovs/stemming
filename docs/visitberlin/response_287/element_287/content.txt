            Healthcare industry meets startup scene: Berlin as key nexus for the World Health Summit 2017

                      

                    

                              It its way, the World Health Summit somehow is so Berlin: international, innovative, and creative, a magnet for clever minds and bold ideas. It is one of the most important health care events in the world and is an indispensable part of the Berlin meetings calendar. From 15 to 17 October 2017, Kosmos will once again be the site for much discussion and sharing of information about health, healthcare, and the future. The event benefits from the capital’s role as a centre for interdisciplinary excellence.

Berlin as a hub for the healthcare industry

Research is always ongoing in Berlin. We now have 40 universities and 60 research centres in the Germany capital, including the Charité Hospital. But that’s not all. Berlin is also a hard-working centre for start-ups, with a new company being founded here on on average every 20 hours.

In short, Berlin is not only a centre for European science, global meetings, but also one of the most relevant start-up cities in Europe. So it only makes sense that an internationally significant conference like the World Health Summit has chosen to be held here for the 9th time already to take advantage of the extensive political, scientific, and industry networks based in the city. Professor Detlev Ganten, Founding President of the World Health Summit, confirms the advantages of Berlin as an event destination:



The Charité University Medical Centre in Berlin helped bring the World Health Summit about and remains a close partner to this day. With the city’s extensive history of medical breakthroughs and the current world-class research being conducted in Berlin, there is no better place for the World Health Summit than Berlin. The city is a living centre for the life sciences with all sorts of research facilities, the healthcare industry, the hospitals, and a startup scene that can compete with the best in the world. There is a constant flow of new ideas. Berlin is also an ideal venue for organising events, since all of the key decision-makers in politics, science, business, and society in general are represented here.


— Prof. Detlev Ganten, Founding President of the World Health Summit


 

“Berlin’s Role in Global Health”

In preparation for the World Health Summit 2017, Berlin’s importance for the modern healthcare sector has already been under discussion. A satellite event as held on 20 September 2017 to discuss “Berlin’s Role in Global Health” as one of the most important sites for life sciences and health in Europe. Participants included Berlin Senator for Finance Dr Matthias Kollatz-Ahnen, Peter Albiez of Pfizer Germany, and Katri Bertram of Save The Children Germany.

Everyone there agreed: Berlin offers great potential for healthcare events, especially for the connections it offers to the startup scene.

Startup scene meets health sector

After having a look at this year’s agenda at the World Health Summit, we are particularly looking forward to the international startup competition on 16 October where ten startups from all over the world will present their ideas. The winner will be announced that evening by Federal Minister of Health Hermann Gröhe. Four German start-ups, including two based in Berlin, will be participating.

Other startups will bee coming from India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and the US to present their creative ideas for improving the provision of healthcare.

Digitalisation and Big Data: Topics at World Health Summit 2017

Whether it is a startup or a major pharmaceuticals maker, the issue of digital solutions is moving the healthcare sector: this year, big Data, digitalisation, health security, and sustainability are on the agenda of the World Health Summit. The summit will welcome around 2000 participants from 100 countries, including seven ministers, two Nobel Prize winners, and leading figures from renowned companies and NGOs (including the Red Cross, Doctors Without Borders, and Save the Children).

Together, they will also discuss topics such as the health policies of the G7/G20, the development of new vaccines, and urban health, and also work on developing solutions for the future.

Take advantage of Berlin’s potential

                We are brilliantly connected - both (inter)nationally and regionally with a unique partner network.
              
                                      
                
                We are engaged free of charge because we act for you by order of the city.
              
                                      
                
                We are neutral because we represent the entire offerings of Berlin.
