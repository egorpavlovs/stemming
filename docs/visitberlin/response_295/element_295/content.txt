          Meeting at the dinosaurs: Berlin’s museums as event locations
              
        
  

  

    
      
        
                    
          
            Meeting at the dinosaurs: Berlin’s museums as event locations

                      

                    

                            

          


          
          Berlin is a capital of culture, with over 180 museums, memorial sites and collections – and so, as the city rightly likes to claim, it has more museums than rainy days! But Berlin’s array of venues showcasing the arts, culture and historical treasures not only open their doors to individual visitors. Some are also available as truly exceptional locations for events. Here, you can find details on eight locations for a different way of visiting a museum.

        
      
    

  

      
        1 Bode-Museum

    
  

  


          
          The heart of Berlin’s cultural landscape is the Museum Island, the world’s largest museum ensemble. The museums at this UNESCO World Heritage site showcase over 6,000 years of art and cultural history – and are well worth visiting for their architecture alone. Here, the Bode-Museum, with its neo-baroque facade and magnificent basilica, is especially outstanding – and is ranked as one of Berlin’s most remarkable event locations. Set among Byzantine art, any event in the majestic Domed Hall or next to Friedrich III’s impressive equestrian statue is sure to be an unforgettable experience.

        2 Brandenburg Gate Museum

    
  

  


          
          The Brandenburg Gate, which marks the old city border, has a wealth of stories to tell. Down the centuries, many have fallen under its spell – including Napoleon. In 1806, he had the Gate’s famous Quadriga statue taken down and sent to France. The fascinating history of Berlin’s landmark site – and how the Quadriga was returned – is recounted in the Brandenburg Gate Museum. Opened two years ago directly next to the Brandenburg Gate, this modern venue at Pariser Platz offers the special feature of embedding events in a 270° panorama and 300 years of Berlin’s history.

        
      
    

  

      
        3 German Historical Museum (DHM)

    
  

  


          
          Many Berlin visitors find this magnificent museum building a real experience in itself. The German Historical Museum (DHM) is not just numbered among Germany’s top museums, but also considered one of Europe’s most attractive baroque buildings. Such a setting is predestined for memorable events – whether in the Schlüterhof, Berlin’s largest interior baroque courtyard, the Museum Café, or the historic Unter den Linden foyer.

        4 Jewish Museum

    
  

  


          
          The Jewish Museum Berlin attracts over 700,000 visitors every year. Europe’s largest Jewish Museum houses an impressive permanent exhibition on over 1700 years of German-Jewish history. With its variety of buildings – from the old eighteenth-century baroque building to Daniel Libeskind’s impressive modern architecture – this museum provides a unique and diverse event location for conferences, seminars, meetings and events.

        
      
    

  

      
        5 Museum for Communication

    
  

  


          
          The Museum for Communication Berlin, originally the Imperial Postal Museum, is the world’s oldest postal museum – and a remarkable venue for conventions in Germany’s capital. The heart of this impressive historic building is a covered atrium ringed by galleries. With exhibits illustrating the fascinating history of communication, the museum on Leipziger Straße offers a setting sure to inspire productive exchanges and debates at meetings and events.

        
      
    

  

      
        6 Natural History Museum (Naturkundemuseum)

    
  

  


          
          Events where participants meet between dinosaurs come with a high ‘wow’ factor – and probably nowhere more so than here. The mounted dinosaur skeleton of Brachiosaurus brancai in Berlin’s Natural History Museum soars to a height of over 13 metres – worth an entry in the Guinness Book of Records. Events are held in the World of Dinosaurs, dominated by this massive exhibit, 150 million years old.

        7 German Spy Museum

    
  

  


          
          Planning a discrete conference? Then you can hardly do better than the Global Operation Room in the German Spy Museum, one of Germany’s most modern museums. The Spy Museum not only houses laser projectors, umbrellas with poison darts and original props from James Bond films, but also cutting-edge technologies for meetings, events and conventions.

        
      
    

  

      
        8 German Museum of Technology (Deutsche Technikmuseum)

    
  

  


          
          Talking of technology – this is another real insider tip for event planners. The German Museum of Technology combines the marvels of technological development with a special setting for meetings and congresses. From aviation history to historic locomotives and an observatory – the museum’s exhibition spaces make the history of technology come alive at conferences, meetings and conventions.
