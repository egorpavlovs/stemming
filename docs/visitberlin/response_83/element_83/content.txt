            German Congress of Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy 2019

                      

                    

                            
                        
                
            
"Psychosomatics in troubled times - familiar and visions" is the theme of the German Congress for Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy 2019.When the decision was made at the end of 2017 to organize the Congress in March 2019, the general unrest that had perhaps begun with the refugee issue of 2015, increased with the decision on Brexit in June 2016 and reached its temporary peak with the election of the American President was felt by almost everyone. The feeling of a crisis had already begun earlier, namely in 2008 with the global banking crisis, and 2017 brought no hope that the events of recent years would actually be seen as a crisis, i.e. as a "high point or turning point" of a dangerous development and thus as timed. Rather, it seems that even social institutions such as political parties, associations or corporations that were previously believed to be stable can only insufficiently redeem the trust placed in them, and that a form of polarization and polemicization is beginning to replace the previously known democratic dialogue. Crises always also have the potential for change. The familiar is abandoned or at least called into question. Depending on the extent of the change, individual insecurity may also result.The German Congress for Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy 2019 offers itself as a place of encounter and exchange in order to discuss and develop possible answers to crises and their management. In view of global changes this may seem illusionary, but interpersonal encounters and dialogues, which are of fundamental importance for psychosomatic medicine, have always been the germ cells of all visions and thus changes. In this sense, we are looking forward to numerous and diverse encounters in March 2019 in Berlin.

                We are brilliantly connected - both (inter)nationally and regionally with a unique partner network.
              
                                      
                
                We are engaged free of charge because we act for you by order of the city.
              
                                      
                
                We are neutral because we represent the entire offerings of Berlin.
