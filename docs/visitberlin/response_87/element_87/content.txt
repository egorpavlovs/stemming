            Interdisciplinary Congress 2019: Quality of Cancer Care (QoCC)

                      

                    

                            
                        
                
            
The German Cancer Society (DKG) and the Association of German Tumor Centers (ADT) organize the congress "Quality of Cancer Care" (QoCC) every two years.The focus is on the quality of oncological care. Unlike other events, however, the QoCC does not address individual aspects. Rather, it is about linking all important topics - from the oncological guideline to certification and documentation to clinical studies and health care research. The idea for this congress arose from the experience that it is often the interfaces between the areas where friction losses occur in the quality development of cancer care. The chosen format of the QoCC, a combination of tutorials, lectures, discussions and poster presentations, offers an excellent platform for a constructive exchange of ideas and experiences to minimize obstacles and friction losses.Among the participants of the QoCC are experts from the following fields and institutions:Tumour documentation, cancer registryguideline developmentCertification, certified centersHealth care research, health economicsBiometrics, Public Health, Epidemiology, Medical Informatics, CROs, Clinical ResearchManufacturer of KIS systemshealth insurance representativesRepresentatives of patient organisationsspecialist media

                We are brilliantly connected - both (inter)nationally and regionally with a unique partner network.
              
                                      
                
                We are engaged free of charge because we act for you by order of the city.
              
                                      
                
                We are neutral because we represent the entire offerings of Berlin.
