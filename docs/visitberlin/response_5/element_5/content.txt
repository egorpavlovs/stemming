        Due to the many historical changes, Berlin is today one of the most fascinating and versatile cities in the heart of Europe! Easy access, great venues and competitive rates teamed up with German efficiency – a winning combination for a perfectly planned event.

        visitBerlin was of the greatest assistance to organise our conference in Berlin, showcasing the best venues in accordance with our needs, as well as organising an out of the box city tour with our top VIPs. visitBerlin is one of the most supportive convention bureaus across Europe, very helpful!

        I would like to thank visitBerlin for its participation in the 2016 FIM Gala Ceremony in Berlin. Without the interest and involvement of Berlin's Convention Office, it would not have been such a resounding success. I was pleased to count on its support at the FIM’s most glamorous event of the year.

        In my opinion, Berlin has something to offer for everyone. If you're a congress organiser, the Convention Bureau is the corner stone for expert advice and assistance. They showcase the city's best traits and attractions and make sure you feel like ‘local’.
