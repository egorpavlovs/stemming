            20th anniversary of the EbM network

                      

                    

                            
                        
                
            
From the 21st to the 23rd of March 2019, the 20 th Annual Meeting of the Network Evidence-Based Medicine will take place at the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin under the motto "EbM and Digital Transformation in Medicine".Digital transformation - understood as changes in care and research through the availability of digital technologies and techniques - is also omnipresent in medicine and healthcare. Collecting, storing, exchanging, networking and evaluating the data (health-related) data has developed rapidly in recent years. Areas of application include: the approaches of personalized medicine, mobile health applications, (partly self-learning) decision support systems in diagnostics and therapy or communicating robots. Above all, at our annual conference we would like to discuss what digital transformation means for the implementation of patient-centered and evidence-based medicine. Can the concepts of EbM be implemented in a digitally transformed healthcare system? Where are the special potentials and challenges? Does it require further or new methodological developments? One of the keynote sessions will explore the potential and limitations of large and heterogeneous data availability to improve patient care under the buzzword "Big Data." Another main session will focus on the importance of digital and ubiquitous applications, the so-called health apps. But, of course, there are other topics in the context of digital transformation that are currently (further) being developed and evaluated, and whose potentials or risks for evidence-based medicine and health care need to be discussed. We therefore ask for submissions of abstracts and proposals for symposia and workshops on the following topics:"Big Data": Are you facing new methodological challenges? Does predictive modeling with big data lead to better decisions?The use of learning systems and algorithms in health-related applications - potentials and risksDigitalization in information management - new formats of information provision, processing and summaryData Literacy: Challenges for Patients, Professionals and OrganizationsThe use of communicating robots and service robotics in health careGood practice examples: Does the use of Health Information Technologies improve care?On Saturday, March 23, 1919, the Department of Patient Information and Participation in cooperation with the Women's Health Working Group organizes a specialist day on "Informed Contraception: Pill, Spiral, Cycle Apps and Co."Again, abstracts can be submitted.

                We are brilliantly connected - both (inter)nationally and regionally with a unique partner network.
              
                                      
                
                We are engaged free of charge because we act for you by order of the city.
              
                                      
                
                We are neutral because we represent the entire offerings of Berlin.
