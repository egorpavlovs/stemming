              The next strategy presentation in a family support centre
          
        
              A team building event in a community centre
          
  
    
  

  


          
              

        
      
    

  

      
        We support you in your planning

    The location at the school was just perfect, all our colleagues were amazed by the arrival in a new atmosphere. The school building and the liveliness of the students created an environment which is unusual for our people and let them come to new ideas. We would definitely do such an event again. We would like to thank MEET+CHANGE for the organization and reaction very fast to our request (...).

        Let your event also play a role in shaping society

    
  

  


          
          Have you also found that sustainability and social responsibility are increasingly important in your business? In addition, many companies are facing growing structural challenges and fundamental change processes. MEET+CHANGE, a sustainable format aligned with CRS standards, responds to these new requirements and needs in your work as an event planner.

              Economic value-added: Your room hire supports social and cultural facilities
          
        
              Ecological value-added: We work with sustainable services and materials for your event
          
        
              Social value-added: A meeting environment encouraging an exchange of ideas and thinking outside the box
          
  
    
  

  


          
          Together with you, we would like to generate new impulses and shape something new and socially meaningful. Our mission is to improve the situation of social and cultural institutions in Berlin.
