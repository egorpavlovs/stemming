            An innovative concept for sustainable events in Berlin

                      

                    

                              Sustainable events have become a fixed component within the MICE-industry. Hereby, companies and associations lay focus not only on environmentally friendly transport- and logistic-solutions and completely „green”-events. Nowadays more and more importance is put on social engagement and social responsibility.

Berlin lives sustainability – creatively and actively

Whether its Germany’s first package-free supermarket or a new consumer fair for sustainable consumption: Sustainability is lived actively in Germany’s capital. Event planners are also able to find Berlin Hotels and service partners which offer concepts for sustainable events.

The hotel Scandic Berlin Potsdamer Platz focuses on following global and local environmental requirements. Whether it’s 100 percent eco-electricity, sustainable meals or ecologically certified conference materials; the hotel meets numerous sustainability requirements. The 5-star-hotel The Westin Grand Berlin allows event planners to organise climate friendly meetings. With FLORIS Catering, Berlin provides a service-partner that not only offers regional and seasonal products of ecological origin, but also a climate friendly vehicle fleet.




Why not organise a creative workshop in a children’s home, a strategic presentation in an elementary school or a teambuilding event in an integrative repair shop? Furthermore, the portfolio of MEET+CHANGE offers children’s homes, family support centres, self-help centres and a refugee cafe.


 

MEET+CHANGE – sustainable events redesigned

How can sustainability in the meeting industry be taken one step further? With MEET+CHANGE Berlin offers a new format, exclusive throughout Europe, which is directly aimed at companies and associations wanting to be engaged in social projects. The initiative format connects rooms in schools, children’s homes and integrative workshops with companies which want to be socially engaged and would like to change their conventional thought patters and routines. Interested companies can book the rooms for creative workshops, meetings or strategic presentations.

MEET+CHANGE follows the objective to improve the situations within social and cultural establishments and offer their facilities to companies and association for events.

MEET+CHANGE: Beneficial for the facilities and participants

How can both the facilities and the participants benefit from MEET+CHANGE?


	The institutions perspective: The locations receive a monetary or in-kind donation from the company or association, such as a beamer for movie nights in the children’s home or a drum set for the school band. The result: What is needed stays at the location and can be used right after the event. The institution decides on the type and level of the donation.
	The participant’s perspective: MEET+CHANGE enables a change of perspective for all participants. This change is inspiring and leads to fresh and new ideas. Especially companies which are experiencing a process of transition, give their employees the chance to take in a new perspective, reflect and question their own corporate culture.




„For an internal workshop we used MEET+CHANGE to find an integrative repair shop for people with disabilities to use as a creative location. The rooms furnishing was great and offered all necessary workshop materials. The service all around, especially individual agreements, worked very well – one senses the attention to detail and the special engagement of everyone involved. The on-site tour was a special highlight for all our participants. We will definitely be back!“

                We are brilliantly connected - both (inter)nationally and regionally with a unique partner network.
              
                                      
                
                We are engaged free of charge because we act for you by order of the city.
              
                                      
                
                We are neutral because we represent the entire offerings of Berlin.
