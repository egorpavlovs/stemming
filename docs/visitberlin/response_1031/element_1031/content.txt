          Conserving natural resources, saving energy and rethinking approaches. In planning events, companies and organisers can significantly contribute to climate protection – and not just by strict regulations, constraints or proscriptions. Quite the contrary. From paperless invitations to a Velotaxi shuttle service or organic catering, Berlin event services and partners offer many innovative ideas for sustainable meetings, incentives, conventions and events in Germany’s capital city. From the very first steps to the realisation of a successful green event in Berlin, Sustainable Meetings Berlin supports event planners with a network of sustainable partners, green tips and creative ideas.

        
      
    

  

      
        Sustainable planning – that’s the way to do it!

    
  

  


          
          The search for innovative solutions for green events in Berlin starts with the question of what sustainability means in practice for event planners and companies.

The German Environment Agency (UBA) explains sustainability by reference to the simple principle of resource stewardship in forestry – anyone using natural resources should make sure that future generations can also profit from them. In other words, event organisers are urged to treat resources responsibly and be mindful of the need for eco-friendly and efficient concepts.

          For event planning, this means concretely: each event should leave the minimum footprint possible and ideally even create value-added. What’s more, this applies to the ecological and economic aspects, just as much as the social components. In this sense, companies planning events are not only asked to consider measures to minimise waste or carbon emissions, but also to take on social responsibility – for example, through accessibility and gender mainstreaming policies or such sustainable event formats as MEET+CHANGE.

        
      
    

  

      
        Sustainability in Berlin’s event sector – strong partners and good ideas

    
  

  


          
          Germany’s capital city has a strong network of sustainable event services and is constantly developing new creative approaches – an ideal location for green events taking ecological, economic and social aspects into account. To support your efficient and eco-friendly conferences, congresses, meetings or incentives in the city, Sustainable Meetings Berlin brings together businesses and event organisers with certified and sustainable partners – from locations to caterers, transport services and hotels. Here, we have collected some tips and ideas to help you plan your events with a good conscience from the outset.

        
      
    

  

      
        >>>>> Tips for sustainable event planning in Berlin <<<<<

    
  

  


          
          Inviting! Here, the rule is less is more. The greenest variation is the paperless electronic invite. But if the haptic experience of holding a physical invitation is important, then Berlin has resource-aware printers and sustainable packing solutions.Tip: Use 100% recycled paper – in comparison to virgin paper, approx. 70% less water and 60% less energy is needed to produce recycled paper. Invites with value-added are also popular and avoid the fast-track to the waste bin. How about a wooden postcard, a pop-up card, a mobile or a seed card? Once planted, the seed card paper will grow into a beautiful sea of flowers! It’s hard to think of anything more sustainable.

Trusting! Especially in the planning phase of meetings, incentives, congresses and events it is not so easy to find the right partner or the most appropriate product. Tip: Accreditation and quality marks help event planners select sustainable partners and event services, and also provide an incentive for businesses to improve their reputation externally (and internally). Examples of trusted and recognised retail ecolabels relevant for CSR (corporate social responsibility) certificates include the Blue Angel, introduced by the German federal government in 1978, the Fairtrade label and the EU organic logo.

With its overview of sustainable partners in Berlin’s MICE sector, Sustainable Meetings Berlin also saves you the work of searching for and comparing services.

        
      
    

  


  
    
              
            

            
                
              
              
            
            

  



  


        
            
          Experiencing! As a rule, the main environmental impact of events is due to travel – both to the event and back as well as at the location. Tip: Encourage participants from within Germany to take a greener travel option with the DB rail Veranstaltungsticket (Meetings Ticket) or use such practical online tools as Doodle or Karzoo to create car pools – allowing participants to get to know each other even before the event. In Berlin, the best option for sustainable travel is the BVG local transport “Congress Ticket” with free travel on the S-Bahn (city railway) and U-Bahn (tube), as well as buses and trams. As an alternative to public transport, why not organise Velotaxis as a green shuttle service or (e-)bikes for a city tour? Or, for an especially memorable experience, how about Segways for location hopping!

      
    

  
  


          
          Planning! Berlin offers a wealth of conference hotels and outstanding locations. Tip: Make sure you opt for fast routes and short distances between the event location and accommodation. When your participants arrive, let them know the best routes with public transport, or to walk or cycle. This not only allows your guests to optimise their time management, but also enjoy a relaxed stay without undue travel.

        
      
    

  


  
    
              
            

            
                
              
              
            
            

  



  


        
            
          Learning! Frequently, accompanying programmes at events include city or sightseeing tours. Tip: For a change, take your guests on a green tour through Berlin – and for the best preparation, join one yourself during your event planning phase. In this way, you can discover creative sites of sustainability, and pass fresh and valuable ideas on to your guests. The learning effect is significant – and guaranteed sustainable!

Saving! Events are often major consumers of energy and paper. Tip: Solar lamps and lanterns are a stylish and energy-efficient way of lighting indoor and outdoor areas. With sustainable solar jar lamps, you can even provide bottled sunlight in your own corporate design – and set an inspiring example for your guests to copy. Talking of lighting, when choosing your event partners make sure they use LED lights, since these require up to 90% less energy than standard lights. In addition, try to manage information flows without printing – especially where a good old blackboard would do instead. This method is just as effective for information signs or details of the food on the buffet – and can be used again and again...

      
    

  
  


          
          Tasting! Producing a kilo of meat requires 22 kilos of grain and 50,000 litres of water.Tip: Make the most of the fresh vegetables available around the year from urban indoor farmers, Berlin city gardens or regional organic farmers to plan a vegetarian meeting – and save around two kilos of carbon emissions. Ideally, source your non-regional products such as coffee and tea from Fairtrade suppliers and - if possible – from packaging-free supermarkets. Incidentally, Berlin’s tap water is rated as especially good. Drinking tap water reduces transport emissions, saves the expense of bottled water, and can easily be provided in attractive carafes or in individual bottles as a give-away.

        
      
    

  


  
    
              
            

            
                
              
              
            
            

  



  


        
            
          Give-aways! All too often, give-aways and corporate gifts have a short half-live before they reach the wastepaper bin. Tip: Design sustainable give-aways with a practical use or as a collector’s item. By working together with Berlin designers on your corporate gifts, you can still offer your participants an array of gifts with a good conscience – from organic cotton bags to seed bombs to throw and grow!

Utilising! Waste and leftover food are a big issue at meetings and events, and often impossible to avoid completely – but they can frequently be recycled. Tip: Donate any unused materials and waste to creative projects. For example, the Kunst-Stoffe - Central Department for Reusable Materials is a non-profit organisation providing “trash” materials for artists, DIYers, and educational facilities. On an app, you can easily post news of leftover food with a number of Berlin food sharing initiatives, ensuring a value-added since the food will not go to waste. Also on the topic of catering, avoid plastic and go for compostable single-use tableware of palm leaves with grass drinking straws. And in Berlin-style, instead of plastic badges or name tags, try adding your message to cool cardboard glasses – and create value-added, since your guests are sure to take them away and continue wearing them.

      
    

  
  


          
          Talking! From the invitation to the welcome and the farewell – at green meetings, talking is gold. Tip: From the start, add “sustainable events” as a topic of discussion for everyone at your event. Be open about telling your participants your sustainability targets and encourage them to become actively involved. After all, who wouldn’t want to play a part at the year’s event ranked best for recycling and with the lowest volume of waste? Afterwards, tell them of the goals achieved – and in this way recommend your sustainable event services, caterers, locations, conference hotels and event technologies in Berlin to other event organisers.

Accessible! As a sustainable event organiser, you bear a responsibility to ensure your event is accessible and gender-neutral, and has a programme designed to include diversity. Tip: From the start, be aware of the accessibility of your event facilities and the need for gender-neutral language. Open up your programme for NGOs, sustainable organisations and projects or representatives of associations working with social issues. Offer workshops on sustainability and show your participants climate-friendly solutions directly at your event.

        
      
    

  

      
        Measuring sustainability – how does that work?

    
  

  


          
          When one event closes, the next is already being planned. Through positive feedback on sustainability goals achieved, event planners give important impulses to other organisers. Such information can best be communicated in a comprehensive sustainability report on measures and impacts. But what would this look like?

As early as 2014, the EU ratified its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Guidelines. In Germany in 2017, these Guidelines were given legal force in a CSR reporting law to improve corporate transparency in areas of social and ecological responsibility in larger companies listed on the stock market as well as banks and insurance companies (with a workforce of over 500 employees). As a result, those companies affected by the EU Guidelines are required to provide details on their progress in environmental, workforce-related and social issues, as well as how they support human rights and the fight again corruption.

Tip: Accreditation and quality marks such as the Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS), a premium management instrument developed by the EU, or the ISO 14001 standard for an environmental management system help companies in their duty to report and heighten awareness of their commitment to sustainability and CSR, both externally and internally. In addition, for event planners such quality marks provide an important reference point for cooperation with service partners and event services.

For planning and organising green events, Sustainable Meetings Berlin’s online platform offers event organisers an overview of transparent, independent and verifiably certified partners in Berlin and a strong network for sustainable event services.
