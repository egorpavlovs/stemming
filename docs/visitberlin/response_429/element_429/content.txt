            7th Annual Conference on Migration and Diversity: Majority and Minority Rights

                      

                    

                            
                        
                
            
Liberal
 thinking and human rights law recognize minority rights. Thus far, 
majority groups have not been granted similar rights because it is 
assumed that they are not vulnerable groups. The majority is presumed to
 be able to “take care of itself”; it can use its numerical advantage to
 perpetuate its political power and interests. Tensions between minority and majority rights are 
among the most pressing issues of our time. The changing patterns in 
global migration reconfigure the cultural landscape of societies and 
shift the dynamics between cultural groups within the state. On one 
side, the backlash against multiculturalism and the reemergence of 
majority nationalism raise new concerns over the tyranny of the 
majority. On the other side, fears over the erosion of majority groups’ 
culture appear due to the pace of migration and the creation of new 
minorities. All these challenges call for the reexamination of 
fundamental assumptions in law and theory. The conference seeks to understand better the 
intercultural tensions between majority and minority rights, the 
reflection of these tensions in law and policy, moral and legal 
challenges they pose to theories of democracy, diversity and justice, 
and their normative consequences. What are the vulnerabilities that 
minorities and majorities face in contemporary societies? Can minority 
and majority rights be asserted based on similar rationales? How do 
distinctive political contexts and histories influence the legal 
responses that shape minority and majority rights? Which policies act as
 barriers against cultural group rights? Confirmed distinguished speakers:   Rainer Bauböck (EUI Florence/Austrian Academy of Sciences) Paul Cliteur (Leiden University) David Goodhart (Policy Exchange) Ayaan Hirsi Ali (The AHA Foundation/Hoover Institution) Christian Joppke (University of Bern) Will Kymlicka (Queen's University) Tariq Modood (University of Bristol)

                We are brilliantly connected - both (inter)nationally and regionally with a unique partner network.
              
                                      
                
                We are engaged free of charge because we act for you by order of the city.
              
                                      
                
                We are neutral because we represent the entire offerings of Berlin.
