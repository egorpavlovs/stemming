From meetings in museums and 1920s-style conventions to congresses in historical sports venues, in industrial monuments, on islands, by the water or in palaces – Berlin really does have it all.

        4 It’s getting greener: Sustainable meetings in Berlin in 2019

    
  

  


          
          Green meetings and sustainable event planning have long ceased to be a trend and instead are becoming a prerequisite for more and more organisers when choosing a congress destination. With the existence of the Sustainable Meetings Berlin platform, event planners have a reliable partner for the organisation of their environmentally conscious and sustainable conventions in 2019.

Tip: In the near future you will find Berlin's Sustainable Partners such as conference hotels, event locations, catering and technical service providers here.

        
      
    

  

      
        5 More community involvement: MEET+CHANGE 2019

    
  

  


          
          Holding sustainable meetings in Berlin does not only mean being environmentally-friendly and green. With MEET+CHANGE, the Berlin Convention Office goes one step further and combines professional event planning with community involvement. How? By event organisers benefiting from the rooms and individual strengths of a social or cultural institution in Berlin for their event and contributing something that is urgently needed here – therefore literally holding sustainable meetings.

        9 Smart planning with an overview: 2019 congress calendar

    
  

  


          
          For many event organisers and participants, the Berlin 2019 convention and congress calendar is an extra incentive to come to the capital. That's because the high density of events attracts international guests to Berlin on several occasions. In addition, various conventions and congresses forge numerous links, such as at the Berlin Science Week 2018, where events from various scientific and social fields were held in parallel over a week, facilitating the exchange of ideas.

          More than 143,272 hotel beds across all categories will be available to convention and congress guests in the capital once more in 2019, meaning that guests from all over the world will feel at home in Berlin even at major events and with the high number of events in the Berlin event calendar.

Tip: In our Meeting Guide Berlin, you can select the appropriate convention hotel for your next event.

        
      
    

  

      
        11 Travel with ease: Transport advantages in and to Berlin

    
  

  


          
          Anyone planning an event with international participants in 2019 will be well connected in the capital – with some 2,775 flights per week from 188 cities. And in Berlin itself, participants and event planners can also travel flexibly and inexpensively by public transport: the journey from the two Berlin airports to the city centre only takes about half an hour. With the Berlin WelcomeCard or low-cost rail offers to Berlin, event organisers and visitors can benefit from good value for money and numerous advantages in the 2019 congress year.
