        Day 1
      
      
        
            
          Morning

Your guests will enjoy a smooth arrival at Hong Kong International Airport – ranked the world's best international airport eight times in 10 years.

Afternoon

After a relaxing morning settling in, your visitors will step aboard Ngong Ping 360, which presents a breathtaking cable car ride over Lantau Island’s majestic mountains to a themed village and the awesome Big Buddha – the world's tallest outdoor seated bronze statue. They can also view the nearby Wisdom Path and the beautiful Po Lin Monastery.

Evening

Under the gaze of the Big Buddha, the themed village of Ngong Ping provides a stunning backdrop for your guests to enjoy welcoming refreshments, followed by a sumptuous dinner and an evening of cultural entertainment.

        
      
      
    

    
      
        Day 2
      
      
        
            
          Morning

Your visitors will get the day off to a healthy start by practising tai chi (Chinese shadow boxing) with an expert beside the Tsim Sha Tsui waterfront. Then, they’ll be off to learn the special rituals of tea drinking at a tea appreciation class.

Afternoon

Foodies will love tucking into some dim sum – an array of mouth-watering Cantonese snacks – followed by a cooking class, where they’ll learn how to prepare some Chinese-style dishes that their friends back home will love.

Evening

Refreshing sea breezes will greet your guests as they arrive to dine alfresco on Lamma Island and enjoy a fantastic seafood dinner. Then, aboard a chartered boat, they’ll witness the A Symphony of Lights dazzling light-and-sound extravaganza, presented by more than 30 buildings on both sides of the harbour. The famous show has been classified as the 'World's Largest Permanent Light and Sound Show' by Guinness World Records.

After dinner, your visitors will enjoy a lovely and quaint experience aboard an antique tram (featuring an open-top balcony with a sofa) that will trundle through the heart of the city.

        
      
      
    

    
      
        Day 3
      
      
        
            
          Morning

A sightseeing trip along Hong Kong Island's Riviera-like coastline will lead your guests to the popular seaside village of Stanley, which is renowned for its street market, temples and colonial-era Murray House.

Afternoon

Next, they’ll step aboard an Aberdeen Harbour 'gondola' to reach the palatial pleasures of lunch aboard the Jumbo Kingdom – one of the world's biggest floating restaurants.

They’ll then board a sampan (a Chinese-style small boat) to tour the nearby Aberdeen fishing village for an up-close look at the life of the local fisherfolk.

The remainder of the afternoon will be spent relaxing over traditional afternoon tea at The Repulse Bay.

Evening

Your guests will head up to Victoria Peak for stunning panoramic views of Victoria Harbour and Hong Kong from the Peak Tower, and enjoy interactive experiences with some of the world’s top celebrities at Madame Tussauds Hong Kong waxworks museum. The Peak also offers a spectacular setting for a memorable dining experience.

To close out the day, your visitors can travel back down the mountain to visit one of Hong Kong’s trendiest nightspots, Lan Kwai Fong or Knutsford Terrace. There are a multitude of bars and restaurants to choose from. And, if time allows, tired feet can enjoy an hour of soothing reflexology.

        
      
      
    

    
      
        Day 4
      
      
        
            
          Morning

For truly stunning views of Hong Kong, your guests can experience a thrilling and panoramic helicopter ride. They’ll marvel at the impressive cityscapes, the magnificent harbour, and South China Sea islands. Then, they’ll come back down to ground to tour some of Hong Kong's famous markets.

Afternoon

The afternoon will be free for shopping in a city renowned for its incredible diversity, where visitors can explore Hong Kong's many nooks and crannies. There are plenty of sights to see, great food to try, and stunning vistas of city, harbour and countryside to discover.

Alternatively, nature lovers may prefer to head to the 60-hectare Hong Kong Wetland Park, where the splendour of Hong Kong's biodiversity awaits.

Evening

If it's a Wednesday during the horseracing season, your lucky guests will experience one of Hong Kong's favourite spectator sports in the luxurious stadium at Happy Valley. The atmosphere is exhilarating, betting is feverish, and guests can dine in privacy and comfort overlooking the track. On other nights of the week, the entertainment options are almost endless!

        
      
      
    

    
      
        Day 5
      
      
        
            
          Morning

Your visitors will spend their last morning learning the art of Lion Dancing – a 1000-year-old Chinese custom that’s a great team-building exercise. They’ll take on different roles: either half of the mythical costumed lion, the Happy Buddha orchestrating the dance, or one of the traditional musicians!

Alternatively, they can head out to Sai Kung for a boat ride to some remote islands set amid dramatic seascapes, including volcanically formed cliffs in the South China Sea. There will also be time for visitors to go for a swim and do some snorkelling in the nearby jade-coloured waters.

The remainder of the day will be free for your guests to experience Hong Kong’s colourful streets before they depart for Hong Kong International Airport.
