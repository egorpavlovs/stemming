											Herbalife Nutrition Extravaganza Goes Big and Bold in Hong Kong
										

									  
										 
                                        Herbalife Nutrition, one of the world’s premier nutrition companies, gave  an enthusiastic stamp of approval to Hong Kong when close to 9,000 Herbalife  Nutrition members from the neighbouring countries and regions, including South  Korea, Japan and Taiwan, gathered at the AsiaWorld-Expo from 14–16 June to take part in its 2017 North Asia Extravaganza.                                        
                                        Herbalife Nutrition members packed AsiaWorld-Expo, the multi-functional  mega event space located next to the airport, in a three-day extravaganza of  lights, camera and action. They enjoyed an electrifying line-up of programmes  which included top-notch trainings by Herbalife leaders and nutrition experts,  fitness sessions to help attendees maintain their healthy active lifestyles, a shake  bar for an energy boost between meetings, a sports sponsorships area for  attendees to catch a glimpse of the latest achievements of sponsored athlete  Cristiano Ronaldo, and a photo-op area where everyone shared exciting moments  of the event that went beyond the Expo.

                    Hong Kong’s connectivity and accessibility made it a destination of choice for our 2017 North Asia Extravaganza. The city’s vibrant lifestyle, diverse culture and plentiful options in everything from hotels to leisure offerings impress Herbalife Nutrition members, while the city’s ‘can-do’ spirit dovetails with our theme ‘Driven by Our Mission, Inspired by Our Results’.  Our event planning went very smoothly and we are very pleased with the support we were given every step of the way and how it turned out.

											13th World Harp Congress: A Journey from West to East 
										

									  
										 
                                        ‘A Journey  from West to East’ is a theme that speaks for itself for the 13th World  Harp Congress, held in Hong Kong from 7–13 July. The city beat a few European classical music hubs for the  hosting right, making Hong Kong the first  Asian destination to bring over 900 of the world's top performers, academics, composers and enthusiasts  from over 36 countries and regions to the event.                                         
                                        Hong Kong,  a city with an East-meets-West DNA itself, provided the perfect meeting stage  for this truly multi-national sensation, welcoming global delegates for a week-long  exchange in the language of music. The city’s superb connectivity and  infrastructure made it easy to bring over 100 types of harps from Europe,  United States and China. The city’s unique venues, love for music and nightlife  also inspire harpists to perform at multiple venues including The Hong  Kong Academy for Performing Arts, Hong Kong Cultural  Centre, Hong Kong City Hall, hotels and  dining venues.
                                          
                                        Let’s hear  why Hong Kong is the perfect spot for hosting the 13th World Harp  Congress: 
                                        
                                        
                                        
                                       
                                       
                                        
                
                  “
                  
                    We chose Hong Kong because it’s a gateway to China, and even Asia. It’s able to attract people in the region where harp is becoming more popular. Hong Kong to me is like a symphony orchestra that has so many contrasts and interesting far-ranging sounds, it has everything!

                    Hong Kong is a great melting pot, I always love Hong Kong because of its incredible mix of culture…if I were to describe Hong Kong as an instrument, it would be harp, because it has so many strings!
