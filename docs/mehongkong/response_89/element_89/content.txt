											Chinese Corporate Executives Join City’s Celebration of the HKSAR’s 20th Anniversary 
										

				   
                  
                 
                  
                  
                  
            What better time to visit Hong Kong  than during the city’s celebration of a historical moment? This year, 18  corporate representatives from Beijing, Shanghai and Qingdao immersed  themselves in the festive atmosphere of the 20th anniversary of the  establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), during their trip to experience the city’s  latest MICE products and offerings from 28 June to 2 July 2017.
            On top of networking and business  exchange with our local trade partners, the group visited hotels and unique  venues such as Auberge Discovery Bay, the Hong Kong Science Park, the Hong Kong Jockey Club’s Shatin Racecourse and the sky100 Hong Kong Observation Deck.
            Apart from enjoying dim sum at a local  tea restaurant, the delegates were also able to create their own ‘dim sum’  through a candle making experience at PMQ, after they experienced an interesting mix  of old and new in Hong Kong through the Old Town Central walking tour, where traditional  culture lives in the contemporary.
              
              The tour concluded with a farewell  dinner at Kerry Hotel Hong Kong, during which the  delegates were able to enjoy dazzling views of Victoria Harbour with a stunning fireworks display in celebration of the HKSAR’s 20th anniversary.

											Hong Kong Hits the 'Suite' Spot at Get Global in Australia
										

										
	 

									  MEHK was amongst the leading ‘Go-Getters’ at the inaugural Get Global MICE tradeshow held at the ICC Sydney on 28 July. Occupying a prime ‘suite’ spot at the event which connected 240 MICE buyers with 120 representatives of hotels, airlines, destinations and other MICE suppliers from 20 countries, the Hong Kong contingent met with quality buyers throughout the day. 


Get Global disrupted the traditional tradeshow setup by introducing a fun, free-flow format. There were no rigid appointment schedules, or 3x3 booths with formal presentations; buyers were encouraged to simply pop in at anytime and connect with as many sellers as they desire.  And the more times their passes got scanned, the more chances they got to win a plethora of prizes. 


With an ROI driven concept, Hong Kong showcased its ‘best’ business offerings, products and reward programmes for hosts of MICE events. Together with an alliance of trade partners on the ground, including homegrown airline Cathay Pacific Airways and newcomers on the hotel scene — Kerry Hotel Hong Kong, The Murray Hong Kong, opening in December — the city recorded one of the highest traffic flows in the Asia Zone. 

Get Global is set to return on 20 July 2018. Save the date and be our guest as Hong Kong showcases the city’s extensive array of business and leisure advantages.
