      Hong Kong Tourism Board ("HKTB", "we", "us" or "our") is committed to protecting and respecting the privacy of those viewing or using our website www.mehongkong.com  ("Website"). The protection of your personal information is very important to us, and we understand our responsibilities to handle your personal information with care, to keep it secure and to comply with legal requirements. If you visit or use our website, mobile, social media and other services through any channels, enrol to our events or programmes, enter lucky draws or competitions, or sign up for our e-newsletter, we may collect and process certain personal information about you.

The purpose of this privacy policy ("Policy") is to provide a clear explanation of when, why and how we collect and use your personal information. We have designed it to be as user friendly as possible, and have labelled sections to make it easy for you to find the information that may be most relevant to you and to allow you to click on a topic to find out more.

Please read this Policy carefully. This Policy is not intended to override the terms of any contract that you may have with us (for example, the terms and conditions you agreed if you sign up to one of our events or programmes) or any rights you might have under applicable data protection laws.

We may make changes to this Policy from time to time, for example, to keep it up to date or to comply with legal requirements or changes in the way we operate our business. We will notify you about significant changes through our website www.mehongkong.com. We encourage you to regularly check and review this policy so that you will always know what information we collect, how we use it, and who we share it with.

This Policy is effective from December 2018.

However, if you do not provide us with certain information, we may not be able to process your submission, provide you with our services or respond to your enquiries.  We may receive information about you indirectly from other sources and combine that with information we collect through our services where this is necessary to help manage our relationship with you. These other sources may include third party software applications or advertising technologies. 

        
      
      
    

    
      
        4. WHAT PURPOSES DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION FOR?

        5. WHO DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH?
      
      
        
          We may share your personal information with our worldwide offices and representatives.

        6. DIRECT MARKETING
      
      
        
          We may use your personal information to send you direct marketing communications about our products and services or our related services including our latest e-newsletter and upcoming events. This may be in the form of email, post, SMS, telephone or targeted online advertisements or in-app notifications. We limit direct marketing to a reasonable and proportionate level, and to send you communications which we think will be interesting and relevant to you, based on the information we have about you.

From the effective date of this Policy onwards, where you register for our events or programmes, sign-up for our e-newsletter or entered a lucky draw and have elected to receive direct marketing information by email or SMS, then for the purposes of the General Data Protection Regulations and where required under relevant e-privacy laws, we will ask you for your consent for our processing of your personal information for direct marketing purposes.

The above statement does not apply if you have previously provided us with your personal information and opted-in to direct marketing in accordance with relevant laws, in these cases our continued processing of your personal information is based on our legitimate interests as further detailed in Appendix 1. 

You have a right to stop receiving direct marketing at any time. You can do this by following the opt-out links in electronic communications (such as emails), or by contacting us using the details set out in Section 12 below. 

        
      
      
    

    
      
        7. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS
      
      
        
          Hong Kong Tourism Board is a statutory body of the Hong Kong Government established under the Hong Kong Tourism Board Ordinance. All HKTB offices are branches of the Hong Kong statutory body, accordingly any personal information which you provide to us via our offices or otherwise will automatically be transferred to HKTB in Hong Kong and your personal information may be accessed or used by staff in HKTB offices or representatives outside Hong Kong. 

We may transfer your personal information to HKTB offices and representatives or service providers that are located outside of the EU.  We will always take steps to ensure that any international transfer of information is carefully managed to protect your rights and interests and is undertaken in accordance with any rules governing such transfers.

You have the right to ask us for more information about the safeguards we have put in place. Contact us as set out in Section 12 if you would like further information or to request a copy where the safeguard is documented (which may be redacted to ensure confidentiality).

        
      
      
    

    
      
        8. PROFILING
      
      
        
          'Automated decision making' refers to a decision which is taken through the automated processing of your personal information alone. This means processing using, for example, software code or an algorithm, which does not involve human intervention. As profiling uses automated processing, it is sometimes connected with automated decision making. Not all profiling results in automated decision making, but it can do.

We may use profiling to ensure that marketing materials are tailored to your preferences and to what we think you will be interested in. This does not have any significant effect, or a legal effect on you. In certain circumstances it may be possible to infer certain information about you from the result of profiling, which may include special categories of data. We will not however conduct profiling based on your special categories of data unless we have obtained your explicit consent to do so. 

Please note that you have certain rights in respect of automated decision making, including profiling where that decision has significant effects on you, including where it produces a legal effect on you. You may find more information in Section 10.

        
      
      
    

    
      
        9. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
      
      
        
          We will retain your personal information for as long as is reasonably necessary for the purposes listed in Section 4 above.

In some circumstances we may retain your personal information for longer periods of time, for example where we are required to do so to meet legal, regulatory, tax or accounting requirements. In specific circumstances we may also retain your personal information for longer periods of time so that we have an accurate record of your dealings with us in the event of any complaints or challenges, or if we reasonably believe there is a possibility of legal action relating to your personal information or dealings.

        
      
      
    

    
      
        10. YOUR RIGHTS
      
      
        
          Subject to applicable laws and regulations, you may have a number of rights in relation to your personal information. For example, under GDPR, you may request access to your data, rectification of any mistakes in our records, erasure of records where no longer required, restriction on the processing of your data, objection to the processing of your data, data portability and various information in relation to any automated decision making and profiling or the basis for international transfers.  You also have the right to complain to your supervisory authority (further details of which are set out in Section 12 below).   

Where permitted by applicable laws and regulations, you may have the following rights:


	Access: you can ask us to provide details of what personal information (if any) we process about you, what we use it for, who we disclose it to, whether we transfer it abroad and how we protect it, how long we keep it for, how you can make a complaint, where we got your data from, you can also ask us to provide a copy of it;  
	Rectification: you can ask us to rectify inaccurate personal information;

	Restriction: you can ask us to restrict (i.e. keep but not use) your personal information in certain circumstances (for example where its accuracy is contested);
	Portability: in certain circumstances you can ask us to provide your personal information to you in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format, or you can ask to have it 'ported' directly to another data controller;
	Objection: you can object to any processing of your personal information which has our 'legitimate interests' as its lawful basis if you believe your fundamental rights and freedoms outweigh our legitimate interests; and
	Automated Decision Making: you can ask for certain automated decisions to be reconsidered by us using human intervention.


Please contact us as set out in Section 12 if you do wish to exercise these rights.

        
      
      
    

    
      
        11. HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
