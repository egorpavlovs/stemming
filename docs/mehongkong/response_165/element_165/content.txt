                        Located on Salisbury Road, Tsimshatsui, overlooking Victoria Harbour, The Peninsula is right at the heart of Kowloon’s business, shopping and entertainment district. Access to Hong Kong’s Mass Transit Railway subway system is less than one minute’s walk from the hotel, enabling guests to travel around the city, the New Territories and into China.  The Star Ferry, a more leisurely way to reach the Island, is a five-minute walk from the hotel, and Chek Lap Kok International Airport is only a 40-minute drive away.  
The Peninsula has additional guest entrances on Nathan, Hankow and Middle Roads.
