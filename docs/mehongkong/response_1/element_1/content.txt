Bon Voyage! Victoria Harbour – Home to floats of all sizes





With magnificent Victoria Harbour, over 260 islands, inlets, coves and hidden treasures, you will be spoilt for choice when it comes to meeting ideas at sea in Hong Kong. The city’s skyline is constantly emerging with new iconic buildings, and same goes for the floats in the harbour. From cocktail parties on a junk to teambuilding with watersports, a great variety of floats are available to create a special event! 



The Vintage Collection 


For planners who appreciate vintage charm and are in the mood for an oriental ride into the past, the city’s in no shortage of nostalgic fleets with a rich story to tell. The collection includes the Aqua Luna and Aqua Luna II, which accommodate 80 passengers each, and the Dukling that accommodates 35 passengers. Cocktail parties on one of the junks as it sails across the harbour is a fabulous MICE idea — branding opportunities are available on the sail or flag of the Aqua Luna and the Aqua Luna II, while the Dukling offers a custom-made welcome banner. Or, charter a trip with the Oriental Dragon, a vessel that caters for anywhere from 40 to 100 people, with a large sightseeing deck and plenty of seating. 


                                
                                                      




The Signature Collection 


Set aside oriental nostalgia, a number of iconic boats with a bigger capacity will certainly take you back to the mesmerizing yesteryears of the fragrant harbour. With a capacity for anywhere from 110 to 180 people, World star and Shining Star will guide you through the story behind the world's most spectacular skyline, while your group dresses the venue up for a party. Hit the water with up to 350 guests with Harbour Cruise – Bauhinia, a twin-decked vessel that serves perfectly as a fully functional event space. 

The Private Collection


From casual yachting to super-luxury
 chartering, you will find a wide range of boat options for anywhere from eight to 55 people, or even a fleet of boats for  larger-sized groups to say ‘ahoy’ together. Options to host your next corporate incentive trips are plentiful, with water sports available, or simply a dinner by the sunset to spice up the entire event. The day’s cruising is limited only by your imagination.

You will be spoilt with what nature has to offer, including lots of beautiful islands and beaches, and a sea of vessels available for your selection to explore Victoria Harbour.
