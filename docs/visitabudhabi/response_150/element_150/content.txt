Review your trip









Just 250km west of Abu Dhabi, on the nature reserve of Sir Bani Yas island, the five-star Desert Islands Resort & Spa by Anantara has a range of lavish rooms, suites and villas, which blend luxurious amenities with rich Arabian touches and sweeping views of the lush surrounding landscape and the Arabian Gulf’s sparkling waters.

Guests can explore the hilltops near the coastline and visit picturesque lakes to admire the pink flamingos against the backdrop of clear blue skies. Encounter breathtaking nature and rare free-roaming wildlife with exciting activities adapted for the island’s unique geographical traits. Lounge beside the resort’s infinity swimming pool, or treat yourself to a sensuous Anantara Spa journey overlooking the Arabian Gulf. 

Nature-inspired activities are part of the visitor experience on Sir Bani Yas island, such as guided nature and wildlife drives, mountain biking, kayaking, sailing, cruising, hiking, snorkelling, falconry and archery. Riding lessons are offered at the Sir Bani Yas Stables equestrian facility, and you can also join an archaeological site tour to marvel at the uncovered remains of an early Christian monastery. A water sports centre also opened at the resort, with diving facilities and classes.
