Review your trip














World-famous classical artist Andrea Bocceli will be back in Abu Dhabi’s award-winning leisure and entertainment destination, Yas Island for one night only on April 26. The world’s most beloved tenor and biggest-selling, global, solo, classic artist is set to enthrall fans at Yas Island’s du Arena with a mesmerising performance encompassing both old and new material.

The Tuscan tenor will captivate you with a spell-binding concert of two parts featuring material ranging from famous operatic sreas to crossover, and popular hits from his first album of new material in 14 years, Sì, which in his own words is about heart and soul, positivity, family, melody and magic. 

The message behind Bocceli's album resonates strongly with the UAE’s Year of Tolerance, sharing many of the same messages and firmly rooted in family and friendship. This is demonstrated beautifully in the spine-tingling duet between father and son, ‘Fall On Me’, featuring 20-year-old Matteo Bocceli.

Having sold 85 million records and performed in some of the greatest concert halls and opera houses, for royalty, Presidents and Popes, Bocceli describes himself as 'a modern, yet old-fashioned tenor' with crossover appeal that has wowed audiences at major international events, including the Olympic Games, and the World Cup, as well as his own sell-out arena shows.   

Andrea Bocceli's name and voice reverberate in every corner of the world, and have become synonymous with his humble persona and unparalleled singing prowess. 

Presented by du Live! and brought to you by FLASH Entertainment, tickets for the event start at AED 395 and go on sale at 12:00 pm on 27th February on www.ticketmaster.ae and all Virgin Megastores across the UAE.
