Ran Jia
The young Chinese pianist Ran Jia gained international attention for her extraordinary interpretative abilities for the piano work of Franz Schubert.

Tan Dun praised her as a “piano poet with dramatic skill in music making.”
For her recording of Schubert Sonatas D 960 and D 664 for the French label Artalinna she was awarded with a Choc Classica in December 2015. Her interpretation was called equal to the famous Schubert recordings by Kempff, Lupu and Richter. “An astonishing album and a name to remember!”

In a special milestone in the 2016/2018 season, she made her Berlin debut with the complete Schubert sonatas in the Philharmonic Chamber Music Hall, that Ran Jia played on four evenings within ten days. Other important appearances included the MDR Sinfonieorchester and the Orchestra Sinfonica Nazionale RAI, concert debut in Sydney and Melbourne in Australia, as well as Rheingau Music Festival in Germany. 
Other highlights of the past seasons include her debuts with China Philharmonic Orchestra, Guangzhou Symphony Orchestra, Hangzhou Philharmonic Orchestra and the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra, led by Chung Myung-Whun.

Her other appearances include her debut at La Roque d’Antheron International Piano Festival in August, at the National Center for Performing Arts in Beijing, concerts at the Shanghai International Piano Festival and the “MISA” Summer Festival in Shanghai, China, recital debut in the sold out Kumho Art Hall in Seoul, Korea and her debut as part of the Albert concert series in Freiburg. She also debuted recently with Hong Kong Philharmonic, Bruckner Orchester Linz, English Chamber Orchestra, Jenaer Philharmonic Orchestra and Würzburg Philharmonic Orchestra.
In 2008 Ran Jia gave her European recital debut when she was 19 years old with a pure Schubert program at the Klavierfestival Ruhr and was enthusiastically celebrated by the audience and critics: with this pianist the structures and sounds flow naturally on its own…Tremendous.”

She also performed at important festivals such as the Dresdner Musikfestspiele, the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Festival, the Gilmore International Keyboard Festival as well as at Tonhalle Düsseldorf and Herkulessaal in Munich. Despite the “impressive debut” (WAZ) at a young age, Ran Jia had to take a break from the concert podium because of injury. She has been back with many highly successful concerts in the musical life for a year now and continues to dedicate her recital programs to the work of Franz Schubert, who plays a central role in her musical understanding.

Shanghai-born Ran Jia began her piano lessons at the age of 3 and has started to perform at the early age of seven years. In November 2005, Ran Jia made her debut at the Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center New York.
Ran Jia studied with Gary Graffman at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia and holds a degree from the University of Music in Cologne. She is currently enrolled at the International piano academy at Lake Como in Italy, where she studies with William Grant Nabore.

Ran Jia released her second Schubert CD recording with two Schubert sonatas in Spring 2017 by Sony Classical. She will make her second complete Schubert sonata cycle in shanghai symphony orchestra hall in march 2019.
