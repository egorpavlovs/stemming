An emerging entertainment destination within a 30 minute drive of the UAE capital, Yas Island is home to the state-of-the-art Yas Marina Circuit – host to the annual F1™ Etihad Airways Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. Get to grips with Yas Marina Circuit through a series of track day packages, including ‘Driver Experiences’, ‘Passenger Experiences’, ‘Private Driving Tuition’ programmes and ‘Racing License Courses’.

At the circuit’s centrepiece is the Yas Hotel, a five star, iconic hotel – the only one in the world to straddle an F1 race track being breathtakingly built half on land and half over water.


Attracting Super Yachts from as far away as Australia for the annual F1™ Etihad Airways Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, the Yas Marina is central to Abu Dhabi’s ambitions of becoming a strong rival to traditional yachting grounds such as the Mediterranean and Caribbean. Overlooking the stunning Yas Marina F1™ Circuit, Cipriani features signature dishes from Harry’s Bar in Venice and classic Italian favourites.


It’s fast and furious fun for all ages at Ferrari World Abu Dhabi
- the world’s first Ferrari-branded theme park. The park tells the Ferrari story with passion and excitement
through more than 20 exhilarating and educational rides and
attractions, interactive shopping and authentic Italian dining
experiences.


Yas Waterworld spans an area of around 15 football pitches, with 43 rides, slides & attractions – five of which are one-of-a-kind. Visitors to this this futuristic waterpark  will be able to try the 238-metre long, world’s first, and largest hydromagnetic-powered, six-person tornado waterslide. For adrenaline seekers there are three-metre high waves on Bubble’s Barrel, which has the world’s largest surfable sheet wave for flowboards and bodyboards. The Bandit Bomber, a 550–metre coaster, is the first with onboard water and laser effects. Riders can shoot jets of water at targets, drop water bombs and trigger special effects, while people below can spray them with water as they pass. A true full day experience, the park draws on Abu Dhabi’s heritage and has ‘The Lost Pearl’ as its theme. It also features a souk, pearl-diving exhibits and restaurants.


On the west shores of Yas Island, Yas Links Abu Dhabi – an award-winning golf course, designed by Kyle Phillips, one of the world's leading golf course architects - is in line with the traditional links golf commonly associated with the coastal towns of Scotland and Ireland. Voted among the 'Top 10 New International Golf Courses' by the influential US publication Golf Magazine, Yas Links features a 7,450 yard par 72 course, utilising five teeing grounds per hole, with all 18 benefiting from ocean views. Recently Yas Links has  also been named one of the world’s top 25
by influential US magazine, Golf Digest.


Set on Yas Island’s tranquil southern shores, Yas Beach is the island’s only stretch of beach. Open daily from 10am – 7pm, it is a great spot to relax and enjoy sun, sea, sand, food and drinks, and there’s plenty of car parking available. Admission, which includes beach towel and sun lounger, is AED 50 (US$ 13.60) for adults and AED 25 (US$ 6.80) for children aged 8-16 during the week, and AED 100 (US$ 27.25) for adults and AED 50 (US$ 13.60) for children during weekend. Children under 8 enter free. Saturday is half-price for ladies. Guests staying at Yas Plaza hotels have complimentary beach access on presentation of their room card or hotel voucher.
 
The island also houses Abu Dhabi’s biggest and the UAE’s second largest shopping centre, the Yas Mall. The mall provides a vibrant getaway shopping experience for tourists, international guests and local residents.
