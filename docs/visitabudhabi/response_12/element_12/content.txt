Review your trip









Essential to any cooking in the Arabian Gulf is the concept of hospitality and generosity. For generations, dining has traditionally been celebrated and shared with a great deal of warmth over the dinner table – in the early days set under cover of Bedouin tents beneath an infinite blanket of stars of the desert sky. Visitors can experience this age-old dining tradition at a plethora of contemporary restaurants, heritage desert camps, and traditional sailing dhows - as well as an array of exciting streetside cafes and restaurants across Abu Dhabi.

In keeping with an historic trading past, fresh produce is readily available. Rise early to catch a glimpse of the plentiful bounty of the Arabian Gulf at Mina Fish Souk – but ‘choose wisely’ to assist sustainable fishing practices – and the Al Mina Fruit & Vegetable Souk is bursting with colour as each seller arranges his produce outside the shops. Even if you are not buying, this area provides excellent photo opportunities.

Today’s visitor can expect an Arabian inspired dinner using the freshest local produce and an assortment of regional spices. Usually consisting of a platter, dishes are prepared using time-honoured techniques, incorporating lamb or chicken, or both as separate dishes, with aromatic rice accompanied by fresh, occasionally spiced seasonal vegetables. Often, a platter of mezze – a selection of four or five appetiser dishes to share – is served with dinner, and sweet desserts, such as Baklava round off the dinner with a traditional Arabian coffee.

LOCAL CUISINE & RESTAURANTS
Take advantage of the opportunity to sample Emirati food - a reflection of the UAE’s trading heritage - infused with spices and ingredients from throughout Asia and the Middle East. Cinnamon, saffron and turmeric, along with nuts, limes and dried fruit heighten the flavour of Emirati dishes, some of the most popular of which are Al Harees, a dish of meat and wheat slow-cooked in a clay oven or pot and served with ghee, and Al Majboos, made by boiling meat in water to which a distinctive blend of spices and dried limes are added. Fish is a mainstay of many local dishes with Al Madrooba, a mix of salted fish, spices and thick sauce being one of the most popular while rice is ever present and is
most often served with saffron, nuts and spices.

You’ll find Emirati cuisine at:
