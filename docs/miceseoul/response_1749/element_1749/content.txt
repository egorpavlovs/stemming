        National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, Seoul (MMCA Seoul) opened in November 2013 in Samcheong-ro (also known as “Culture Street”). As an art and culture complex with a Digital Library, Multi-Project Hall, and movie theater (MMCA Film and Video) within an exhibition and education facility, the MMCA Seoul offers visitors the chance to experience a variety of culture and arts genres (exhibitions, movies, performances, education, etc.) through which they can see the flow of contemporary art at a glance. Surrounded by a yard, the MMCA Seoul harmonizes with the former Defense Security Command and Jongchinbu buildings. Visitors can also appreciate a distant view of Inwangsan Mountain, which is featured in Gyeomjae Jeong Seon’s Inwang jesaekdo. Facing Gyeongbokgung Palace, which is located at the center of Seoul, the MMCA Seoul aspires to be an “open museum” that communicates with every visitor from home or abroad. A place where anyone can go to take in contemporary art, the “open downtown museum” of MMCA Seoul offers to all the joy of being able to appreciate culture and the arts.TransportationSubway Station: 14 min walk from Exit No. 1 from Anguk Station, Subway Line # 317 min walk from Exit No. 2 from Gwanghwamun Station, Subway Line #5Nearby Hotels and AttractionsWithin 2km: Four Seasons Hotel Seoul Within 2km: The Plaza SeoulStreets: Samcheong-dong, Insa-dong, Bukchon(Bukchon hanok village), seochonHistorical and cultural sites: Gyeongbokgung Palace, Changgyeonggung Palace, National Folk Museum of KoreaFACILITIESName of HallLocationSize(㎡)StandingSeatedEducation Building, Lecture Room12F120.6-50Education Building Lounge2F109-80Gyeongbokgung Madang3F409.7150-Major EventsExhibition: Contemporary artEducation: Professional Development, Public, Exhibition Related Program (Year-round)Event: Exhibition Related Event, Seasonal Event (Year-round)Special FeaturesFacing Gyeongbok Palace and Samcheong-dong, which is new center of Korean culture in the city centerAn open museum with a variety of facilitiesFuture-oriented art museum to meet contemporary artCulture complex with Digital library, Multi project hall, Movie theater(MMCA film and video)
