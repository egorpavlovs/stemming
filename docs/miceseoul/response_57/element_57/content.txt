		Seoul is a modern metropolis surrounded by mountains and divided by the Hangang. The city has several parks and trails, and pursues various policies to preserve the environment such as using eco-friendly fuel and vehicles, hosting green international conferences, and operating environment-friendly convention centers. Such policies are also reflected in the city’s administration as it purifies rain water and has water recycling centers and Arisu (brand name of Seoul’s water supply) purification centers. Seoul also boasts a strong foundation for information technology, providing access to the Internet from any location and various applications in people’s daily lives. The city features ubiquitous-based services, digital pavilions, and an exhibition space at Samsung Electronics, offering new and futuristic experiences in high-tech IT.
