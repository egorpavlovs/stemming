CRAB HOT POT AND TEMPURA 

 

5 January 2015, Seoul, Korea… Millennium Seoul Hilton
is showcasing Crab Hot Pot and Tempura throughout the month of January at the hotel’s
acclaimed Japanese restaurant, Genji.  A
special set meal will offer the warm, nourishing, and flavourful flavours in
the King Crab Hot Pot as well as highlight the beauty of Japanese tempura.  

 

The set meal is priced at KW108,000 per
person and will include: an assorted salad; three types of sashimi (tuna,
halibut, salmon); a bubbling hot pot filled with King Crab, abalone, shrimp,
cod fish, clams, and vegetables; crispy tempura made with shrimp, cuttlefish,
sea eel, King Crab, onion, and pimento. 
The set will also include steamed rice and fresh sliced fruits.  

 

Tempura was first introduced to Japan by
Portuguese missionaries.  Though now
mostly synonymous with Japanese cooking, tempura comes in a variety of batters
(from light and lacy to thick and cakey) and uses a wide assortment of
ingredients such as shrimp, squid, small fish, vegetables, etc.  

 

All prices are inclusive of tax and
service charge. 

 

For
reservations or enquiries, please call Genji at (02) 317-3240.
