		2015-08-05
		
			
			 Press Release: Seoul Announces Five New Incentives to Attract Business Events Beijing, China August 4, 2015 -- Seoul has launched a series of new initiatives aimed at attracting major MICE events. The new programs were announced by Mayor Park Won Soon during the Seoul MICE Beijing Road Show at the Renaissance Beijing Wangfujing Hotel. His attendance is one of many scheduled events as part of his promotional tour to Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Beijing this week showcasing Seoul as a MICE and tourism destination.The first measure offers two options in association with upcoming major autumn events in Seoul. Business events with 50 or more delegates staying at least two consecutive nights can apply for either complimentary reserved seats at the Seoul Mega Concert, a K-Pop musical concert at Seoul City Hall plaza scheduled for early October, or at this year’s Seoul International Fireworks Festival set to take place on October 3. Seats for either events will be reserved on a first-come-first-serve basis.The second measure is open for events through June 2016 and offers organizers a package of three benefits which includes a 10,000 KRW food credit per person, a coach for a city tour, and up to 3,000,000 KRW in credit towards a Seoul performance.Application deadline is September 30 for both measures and inquiries can be made through mice@seoulwelcome.com.Both new measures are in addition to Seoul’s long standing business event support program that has recently relaxed restrictions to make qualifying easier than ever for promotional and on-site support programs and services. Seoul will also continue its marketing efforts at CIBTM- a global MICE exhibition - which will take place at the China National Convention Centre (CNCC) August 5 - 6.  The Seoul Convention Bureau will be located at booth number F162.The Seoul Convention Bureau, a division of the Seoul Tourism Organization, is the official government-sponsored body representing and promoting the city overseas as a prime venue for meetings, conventions and exhibitions. It also provides multilayered support to foreign and domestic event planners choosing Seoul to host their conference, and acts as an information service for business tourists and the media on Seoul’s conventions infrastructure.
