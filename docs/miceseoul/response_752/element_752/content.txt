Introduction.

High population growth, increased life expectancy coupled with high
mortality rate and ageing, prevalence of lifestyle related diseases and
aspiration of high quality healthcare is putting pressure on healthcare
providers to be more innovative and invest in providing high quality care and
integrated services and equipment. Although healthcare challenges can vary from
region to region, health systems of every type around the world have the same
objective: to finance and deliver the highest possible quality of care to the
maximum number of people at the lowest possible cost. Having this in mind, the InnoMED
( Innovative Medicine and Healthcare Technologies) Conference aims to provide
innovative strategies to improve the quality of healthcare delivery whilst
reducing costs and assessing the latest medical and management technologies for
improving public and patient medical and healthcare. The conference will bring
all medicine and healthcare stakeholders together including healthcare leaders
from health authorities, technological companies; providers from both the
government and private sector, public policy makers and investors.
