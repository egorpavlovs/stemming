		Seoul’s Meetings Industry Showcased at Korea MICE Expo 2013 to Global Industry Professionals
		2013-06-28
		
			
			
Seoul’s meetings industry took center stage this past June 26-27, when members of the international business events community, including buyers, key industry professionals, and media attended Korea MICE Expo (KME) 2013 at the city’s Coex convention and exhibition center. The annual event, which is Korea’s largest meetings industry trade show, included a buyer pre-tour of Seoul, a special welcoming dinner with entertainment for meetings industry VIPs, and a media tour of the city.
At the KME exhibition floor, 350 buyers and other participants had the opportunity to meet directly with members of the Seoul Tourism Organization (STO) and also 33 members of the Seoul MICE Alliance, an industry partnership of the city’s major business events companies at the STO Booth (P-09).
A highlight of the KME was the official Welcome Dinner on June 26th, a gala evening hosted by the Seoul Metropolitan Government and Seoul Tourism Organization. At the event, overseas industry guests and local VIPs networked, sampled Korean cuisine, and enjoyed entertainment, including a masterful showcase of the Korean martial art taekwondo.
In attendance at the Welcome Dinner was Kim Sang Bum, Seoul Vice-Mayor for Administrative Affairs, who affirmed the importance of the Korea MICE Expo in promoting the nation’s meetings capabilities to the world, saying, 
“Seoul is very happy to serve as the host city for the Korea MICE Expo. The Seoul Metropolitan Government is working hard to foster the city’s MICE and travel industries, as they are powerful economic drivers for Seoul.”
"The Korea MICE Expo is a great opportunity to discover the various local powerhouses that make Seoul a world top 5 convention destination," agreed Sung-Real Lee, STO President and CEO, who was also in attendance, adding,
"We were very happy to see how well our Welcome Dinner and Seoul tours were received by buyers and media, and hope they leave with a strong impression of what makes Seoul ‘Your Complete Convention City’."
On Tuesday June 25th, prior to the KME, 80 buyers had the opportunity to explore some of the city’s key MICE infrastructure during a pre-tour around Seoul, including some of Seoul’s convention hotels, meeting venues, and local attractions. The tour was hosted by the Seoul Metropolitan Government and the Seoul Tourism Organization.
On June 27th, the IMEX-MPI-MCI Future Leaders Forum took place at Coex. The forum was attended by Korean students of business events and tourism from across the country, and they were inspired by today’s industry professionals from both home and abroad through a series of lectures and discussions. The program was hosted by Miguel Neves, Knowledge & Social Media Manager for the IMEX Group, and guest speakers included Seoul Convention Bureau vice-president Maureen O’Crowley and Tyra Hilliard, an associate professor at University of Alabama and winner of the STO’s What Is Gangnam Style social media promotion held last November.
The Korea MICE Expo has been Korea’s premier meetings industry trade show, offering a golden opportunity for local and international business events professionals to showcase and discover the nation’s ever-growing capabilities as an event destination.
The Seoul Tourism Organization would like to thank all who attended KME 2013, and looks forward to meeting everyone again in the near future.
