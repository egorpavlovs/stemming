								Introduction
Founded in April of 1976, Korea Convention Services (Koconex) has the proud distinction of being the first Professional Congress Organizer in Korea. Over the course of its nearly 40 year history, Koconex has organized nearly 400 events of all categories and sizes, including the 3rd ASEM Summit Meeting, 6th APEC Summit Meeting and the 22nd World Congress of Dermatology ? the largest scientific congress held in Korea to date. In addition, the 20th World Congress of the International Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies also has been organized by Koconex, which was remarked as one of the most successful scientific congresses has been held in Korea. It was designated one of the “34 Best Tourist Facilities and Services” by the Korea Times and has received strong recognition and numerous awards from the Korean government for its work. Most recently, Mr. Hyun-mo Chung, the President, has received the Silver Tower Order of Industrial Service Merit from the President of the Republic of Korea at the 41st Tourism Day in Korea. We are proud to announce that it is the first time for an employer to receive commendation in the convention field, not in the tourism industry
Mission Statement
Koconex aims to organize and manage congresses and exhibitions of the highest-quality standard possible, to judge and manage quality, efficiency, effectiveness and costs by creating the right chemistry of personal involvement, flexibility and creativity, and by combining specialized knowledge and expertise ? resulting in successful congresses and exhibitions.
