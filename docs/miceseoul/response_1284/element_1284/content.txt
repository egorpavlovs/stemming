		Seoul Tourism Organization brings a bit of peace and tranquility to EIBTM 2009

			Come and experience a Korean Traditional Tea Ceremony with Seoul
Seoul, South Korea - The Seoul Convention Bureau (SCB) will be attending this year's Europe Incentive Business Travel & Meetings (EIBTM) held in Barcelona, Spain. The exposition will be held from December 1st through to December 3rd 2009, and this year the SCB will be hosting their own booth representing both Seoul and Korea. This year's event will feature intimate demonstrations of a traditional Korean tea ceremony (Darye) at the Seoul booth.
'Darye' literally means 'etiquette for tea' or 'daily tea ritual' which has been preserved among the Korean people for over two thousand years. Tea ceremonies are now being revived in Korea as a way to find relaxation and harmony in a fast-paced world, while maintaining the country's long traditions. The SCB has invited some of the foremost experts on Korean tea to perform the ritual from the Bosong region, famous for green tea.
The EIBTM is the European leg of the Reed Travel Exhibitions Meetings & Incentives Events series. EIBTM is the leading global event for the meetings and incentive industry. Held in Barcelona each year, the event delivers three days of focused access to a dynamic business environment, thought-provoking professional education, and business networks for exhibitors, hosted buyers and trade visitors.
Last year's EIBTM attracted over 3,700 buyers from 400 cities totaling 8,000 participants including exhibitors and visitors. The event also hosted over 1.2 million pre-scheduled meetings (PSA), an increase of 11,000 from the previous year.
The SCB looks forward to exposing their new branding, 'Seoul: Your Complete Convention City', as well as meeting buyers and networking with other industry professionals. The SCB invites you to come, relax and visit them at their booth to sample Korean Traditional Tea, get a sense of Korean culture and history, and talk to friendly SCB staff who can offer more information about Seoul and freely answer any questions you might have.
Seoul is currently ranked 7th in the world for hosting international conferences, securing 125 meetings in 2008, according to the Union of International Association. Both the Korean Government and the Seoul Metropolitan Government have designated the convention industry as one of the key strategic industries to boost the economy.
For more information please contact Martin Kim at the Seoul Convention Bureau (+82 2 3788-0822, martin@seoulwelcome.com), or visit the EIBTM website at www.eibtm.com/ Seoul Convention Bureau will be in booth D520.
