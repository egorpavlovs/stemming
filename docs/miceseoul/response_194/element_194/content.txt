The
Mackiss Company which is the largest alcoholic beverage company in Daejeon City
and Chungcheong Region was established in 1973 with the motto
"creativity" and "public interest support". With this motto, the Mackiss Company has launched Soju
"O2 Linn" since 1973. O2 Linn contains triple oxygen of what other
sojus have. So it helps people sober up 30 minutes earlier than others. Also,
the Mackiss Company continuously has held the nature-friendly and CSV(Creating
shared value) concept events such as Red Clay Festival in Mt. Gyejok, Topless
Marathon and Mackiss Opera for local communities. In October 2017, the Mackiss Company
has newly launched "Art-Interactive Theme Park" in Seoul,
L’atelier, providing a time machine to travel back to 19 Century France. L’atelier is a new concept theme
park that maximizes visitors’ experience by various artistic attraction, entertainment, and
intelligence technology. Fully enjoy masterpieces of 19th century Impressionists such
as Vincent van Gogh, Claude Monet, Maurice Utrillo, Edouard-Leon Cortes and
others. We reproduce Paris and Arles of 19th century France in those
masterpiece not only with dioramas but also with people who lived in that time.
They become the part of the paintings by talking to people who live in
L’atelier.
