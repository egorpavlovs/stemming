Grand Ambassador Seoul Upgrades
Again!

Opening of Japanese Restaurant ‘Sushi 孝(hyo)’ and Spa ‘OCELAS’ 



 

The Grand
Ambassador Seoul has upgraded its facilities yet again with the refurbishment
of its Japanese restaurant and spa, following on from last year’s remodeling of
the grand ballroom and the Chinese restaurant. 

 

The hotel’s
Japanese restaurant ‘TA-KE’ was reopened as Sushi孝 (hyo
means ‘filial duty’ in English) on September 12, 2014. ‘Sushi孝’ is run by Chef Ahn Hyo-ju[h1] , who earned a nickname as Korea’s Mr. Shushi
King (the title of a famous Japanese cartoon) during a cooking contest reality
show (the Korean version of Mr. Shushi King), and is well-known as one of the
best Korean sushi restaurants among gastronomes in Korea. Under the motto “We
only serve food that we would serve to our parents with a warm heart,” the
restaurant serves distinctive and delicious cuisine by incorporating unique
trendy recipes with traditional Japanese cooking methods. Located on the second
floor of the hotel, Sushi孝 consists of a main hall with 28 seats, a sushi bar with 9 seats, and
8 special rooms that are optimal for small group meetings and seat 12, 6, or 4
persons. The restaurant offers an exciting range of menus including a lunch set
menu starting from KRW 55,000, a dinner set menu starting from KRW 125,000, and
single dishes (VAT is included in the prices).

Meanwhile,
Balneo Therapy, which previously provided traditional French style therapy
programs, has been reopened as OCELAS to offer a European prestige spa experience.
OCELAS, which is derived from the English words OCEan, Land, Air, and Sun, uses
‘beauty from nature’ as its motif. Clients can enjoy the spa’s relaxing
ambience amid natural scents and soothing music, and immerse themselves in a
truly healing experience through spa programs performed by professional
therapists gifted with a delicate touch. OCELAS provides diverse spa programs
including La Stone therapy, the spa’s representative program in which stones are
used to maximize the natural healing ability of the human body, and around
fifty high-class spa programs. All the programs use products by Comfort Zone,
an Italian high-class spa cosmetics brand. OCELAS, located on the first
basement level of the hotel, comprises four single rooms, a room for couples, a
dry space, a water therapy room, and a spa lounge. The spa is open daily from
10am to 10pm (closed on the first Wednesday of each month).
