		[Press Release]Destination Seoul for MICE looks bright with 2,700 confirmed participants to visit Seoul on incentive tours
		2018-01-24
		
			
			Two major companies from Malaysia and Indonesia are scheduled to bring a total of 2,700 employees to Seoul on incentive tours, making it this year’s first two incentive tour groups to visit Seoul. With PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games just around the corner and the confirmation of the peaceful participation of our North Korean neighbors, the South East Asian corporate executives and their employees find no problem to join one of Seoul’s most popular tours.The total 2,700 participants consist out of 1,200 employees of Sahajida Hai-O Sdn. Bhd, a marketing specialist in Malaysia, and 1,500 employees of Tupperware, an Indonesian global kitchen container manufacturing company. The large number of exciting participants predicts a positive outlook on Seoul’s business events industry.The Malaysian company Sahajidah Hai-O Sdn. Bhd is established in 1992 and manufactures water filters, beauty products and health products. Their businesses are located in Indonesia, Singapore and Brunei and the total number of employees is about 160,000.The Indonesian incentive group from company Tupperware, headquartered in the United States, is known as world's number one manufacturer of kitchen and home products that included storage products, plastic containers, and more. Since its founding in 1946, it became a global organization with active sales and marketing activities of 2.6 million employees in 16 factories and 100 countries.The Malaysian tourists, divided in 8 groups will be visiting Seoul from Monday the 15th until Monday the 22nd. They signed up for the traditional hanbok experience, where they will be touring through Gyeongbokgung Palace while dressed up in the Korean traditional clothes. They will also visit Seoul N Tower, Namdaemun Market, Myeongdong shopping district and other major tourist attractions to experience the many charms of Seoul.The Indonesian group will visit Seoul in March and will make use of the K-pop experience program considering the substantial interest in Hallyu or Korean Wave. They will also visit Bukchon Hanok Village, Dongdaemun Market, Gyeongbokgung Palace and the Folk Museum.Kim Jae-yong, head of Seoul city’s Tourism Policy said "The success of acquiring these tourist groups is due to the aggressive marketing efforts of the city to attract South East Asian tourist groups instead of Chinese ones”. He added, "We will do our best to provide unforgettable memories and excellent hospitality services during their stay in Seoul, so that so they will want to return in the future."With the aim of diversifying leisure and MICE tourism, the city of Seoul and the Seoul Tourism Organization (STO) has been continuously carrying out joint marketing activities with the Korea Tourism Organization, Incheon Tourism Organization and Gyeonggi Tourism Organization. Also, meetings were held in September last year with travel agencies that specialize in incentive tourism to promote the city's support programs and to exchange various thoughts for capturing the Southeast Asian market. Onsite marketing in countries including India (March), Indonesia and Philippines (April), Malaysia and Singapore (May), Taiwan (June), Vietnam (November) and Japan (December) have been carried out by the Korea Tourism Organization with STO in efforts to attract MICE tourism to Seoul, where a variety of customized tours or team building programs were introduced.The participation in IMEX America, Las Vegas last October is one example of the various efforts made to attract visitors, where real cases of incentive tours were introduced, such as a Malaysian incentive group that visited Seoul last November that made use of a cultural hanbok experience program, and an Indonesian company that visited Seoul in June last year, to participate in a Seoul Fam tour.The STO along with the city of Seoul supports foreign groups who visit Seoul by providing 20,000 KRW to 30,000 KRW per foreign visitor each in a group on the condition that the foreign participants stay in Seoul for at least 2 or more consecutive nights up to a 100 days.
