The Photo Artists Society of Korea (PASK) has been the
nation’s foremost photography association since its establishment in 1961.
Through its members, the society plays an important role in the development of
local culture and photography by supporting local artists, programs, and other
endeavors in the field. In 2016, PASK held the 33rd Federation Intenationale de
Art Photographique (FIAP) Congress, which 400 Photographers from 57 countries
visited Seoul. FIAP, also known in English as the International Federation of
Photographic Art, is the only photographic society to be officially recognized
by UNESCO. Its membership includes over one million persons affiliated with
FIAP- approved branches and associations. Congress and Photo meeting are held
every two years in rotation. We have plans to host another big FIAP event, the
Photo Meeting.
