A highly-popular dance musical, Sachoom is
a non-verbal performance that tells a heartfelt coming-of-age story through the
language of dance. The play seeks to express itself through the universal
language of movement accompanied by a simple story. The usual barriers between
audience and performers collapse as enthusiastic audience members join in.
Sachoom wakes up the suppressed cells of the body and encourages the spectator
to truly be at one with themselves. Stylish scenes are created with powerful
dance by talented performers. During the show, performers will encourage the
audience to participate in the show with hearty cheers. Sachoom looks forward
to welcoming all of its international guests, and has also been performed in
several venues around the world.
