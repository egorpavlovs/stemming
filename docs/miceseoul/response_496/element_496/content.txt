        Owned and operated by The Shilla Seoul, Yeong Bin Gwan is a unique dining 
and event space located in the hotel grounds. Built in the style of a hanok 
(traditional Korean house), the two-story facility was originally designed to 
accommodate foreign VIPS, and can now be used for a variety of dining functions, 
including banquets, parties, and corporate dinners. Yeong Bin Gwan is divided 
into three banquet spaces (Emerald, Ruby, and Topaz), each capable of seating 
between 100-250 guests at a time. Special events can also be held in the nearby 
scenic hotel garden.
