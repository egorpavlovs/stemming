		Members of Seoul’s Tourism Business Sectors Vow Solidarity in Bolstering Seoul Tourism (STO Press Release)
		2015-07-23
		
			
			Seoul, South Korea, July 21, 2015 – Close to 60 members from various sectors of Seoul’s tourism industry gathered at the Plaza Hotel’s Maple Hall to seek a united front in boosting Seoul city’s tourism. The participants included employees of hotels, restaurants, tour groups, and other tourism-related fields who came together on Tuesday, July 21 for the Seoul MICE Alliance Professionals Meeting.
The SMA Professionals Meeting is a regular gathering and networking event for professionals of the Seoul MICE Alliance, partnership between government agencies and private-sector organizations working to enhance the city's global business events competitiveness

The meeting began with a “hope wall” event in which members took the time to write and post notes of encouragement for the city’s tourism sector which has experienced declines in recent months. The positive messages were written in a variety of languages with participants taking the time to pose with placards in front of the wall.

An overview of the Seoul Metropolitan Government’s recently expanded programs and services for the city’s tourism industry as well as the Seoul Convention Bureau’s added MICE support and services was provided with explanation and participation by members of both the Seoul Metropolitan Government and the Seoul Convention Bureau.
SMA members then shared ideas on how to rebound and improve, networked and exchanged collaborative ideas, and capped the meeting with group pictures to show their solidarity.

Following the Professionals Meeting, the Seoul Convention Bureau hosted a guided tour of the currently ongoing PEACEMINUSEONE: Beyond the Stage exhibition at the Seoul Museum of Art- a special collaborative exhibition between K-Pop star G-Dragon, of Big Bang, and various artists.
