These, combined with the facility’s highly-professional  service designed to maximize exclusivity and comfort, make Samcheonggak an event  venue of the highest caliber. There is also an on-site Korean restaurant as  well as a garden cafe that also offers traditional tea ceremonies suitable for  business meetings and other small gatherings.Add a taste of Korea to any international event in a setting guaranteed to  lend it the ambience it deserves by choosing Samcheonggak, a one-of-a-kind event  space.TransportationFrom Incheon Int’l Airport: 80 minSubway: Free shuttle buses outside Gwanghwamun Station (Line 5) available*     Free Shuttle Bus: Runs every hour from 10am-9pmStops: Gyeongbokgung     (Palace) - Jogyesa (Temple) - Jonggak Station - Euljiro 1-ga Station - City     Hall - Gwanghwamun StationNearby hotels & attractionsWithin 5km: Lotte Hotel Seoul, The Plaza, Koreana Hotel
