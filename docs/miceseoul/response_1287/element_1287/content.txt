		Seoul Selected as Venue of G-20 Summit in 2010
		2009-10-15
		
			
			Seoul has been selected as the host of the G-20 summit to be held in November 2010, Cheong Wa Dae said Friday, citing its superior infrastructure over other candidate cities.
After Korea was named as a venue for the gathering of leaders from the world's 20 most advanced economies next year, Seoul, Incheon and Jeju all competed to host the international event.
Cheong Wa Dae spokesman Park Seon-gyu said the G-20 summit, the largest international event ever to be held in Korea, requires a large-scale convention center, accommodation and security, adding the government had no other choice but to make the best use of existing infrastructure with only 12 months left before the meeting.
"Seoul has many hotels and a convenient transportation network. Also, for security reasons, it is better prepared than other metropolises here. But gatherings of ministers and other government officials, as well as many sideline events, will be held in a number of cities," Park said.
Expected to attend are thirty-five heads of state, 10,000 participants and the leaders of major international organizations including the European Commission, the UN, the World Bank, the IMF and the Financial Stability Forum.
