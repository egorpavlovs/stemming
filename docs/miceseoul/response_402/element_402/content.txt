Baesan
Archive, opened Nov.2017, a place renovating warehouse into industrial-tyle Café
and event space, is located in Seongsu-dong,Seoul’s shoemaking district.
By 1980s, Seongsu-dong was home to many businesses in handmade shoemaking
industry. But as mass production of shoes started to take over, Seongsu-dong
district decayed. After Seoul designated Seongsu-dong a site for urban
regeneration, young artists started to settle in the neighborhood’s
deteriorating industrial spaces and repurposed them into cafes, restaurants,
and craft workshops. Baesan is one of the place as well.
Baesan Archive is originally built as rice mill in the 1970s and the turned
into a warehouse in the 1990s, the structure’s industrial past lives on through
its exposed brick and becams,high ceilings, and concrete interior. Decorated
with edgy art installations, Baesan is hip, industrial-stylr event space ideal
for product launches or exhibitions. One of its latest events saw SAMSUNG
holding their GALAXY NOTE 9 lanuching part, GALAXY FAN PARTY within the place.
Baesan Arichive offers 990sqm of event space, over 9 meters height of ceiling
on the first floor, the rooftop on the second floor, suitable for up to 400
persons and flexible seating arrangements.
