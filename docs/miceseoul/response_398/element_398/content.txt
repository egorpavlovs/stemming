The National Museum of
Korean Contemporary History is a space where visitors can experience both
cultural enrichment and participate actively in Korea’s historical dialogue.
The museum is dedicated to passing on to the next generation the major
milestones in Korea’s history from the nineteenth century to the present day,
charting the remarkable growth made possible in the country through the
resilience and integrity of the Korean people. It is here at the museum where
we reflect on the past in order to open our minds to the possibilities of the
future.

The museum is located on a site of historic and symbolic importance and
neighbors other historical and cultural facilities. The museum building was
once a government building home at different times to the Economic Planning
Board and the Ministry of Culture, Sports & Tourism. It was recently
renovated with eco-friendly, “green” materials and energy-saving technologies
to reflect today’s environmental mindset.
