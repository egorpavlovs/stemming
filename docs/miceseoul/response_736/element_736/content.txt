	Grand Hyatt Seoul in Your Pocket - new mobile application launched

Grand Hyatt™ Seoul launches new mobile application

Celebrate with a chance to win a luxurious vacation
experience


 
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  



     Grand
Hyatt™ Seoul is launching a new lifestyle app that delivers a host of
information about hotel rooms, restaurants, lifestyle events and places of
interest near the hotel.  To celebrate
the launch of the app on September 1, a special social event, “Staycation of
Your Dreams”, will be held throughout the month of September.     The biggest feature
of Grand Hyatt™ Seoul’s app, which
differentiates it from similar apps, is its ability to also look at happenings
outside the hotel.  Through the use of a
new technology called Beacon, the Grand
Hyatt™ Seoul app offers guests dynamic information on events going on
around them at any given moment.  



    Beacon is a
communication technology system that identifies activities going on within a 50
m to 70 m radius of any mobile device and provides related information about
these events — along with happenings at the hotel — via the app.  For example, if a guest who has installed the
app passes through the lobby, he or she will receive a stream of information
about events going on in the Lobby Lounge. 
Via the “City Guide” menu tab, the app also provides recommendations
from the hotel’s concierge about great restaurants and favorite tourist spots.  Guests will always know everything that is
going on around them, as the app keeps them informed no matter where they are
headed.  And thanks to its link to Google
Maps, the app makes any place in the city easy to find.  

    For more leisurely
browsing, the app also provides access to Grand
Hyatt™ Seoul’s monthly members’
magazine, J.J. Magazine.  Plus, payments
can be made through the app.   “The Grand Hyatt™ Seoul mobile application is
yet another differentiator that reflects the hotel’s commitment to guest
satisfaction.  With this application, the
first to be launched in Asia, we have found the means to communicate more
personally with our guests and better respond to their diverse needs and
interests,” said Grand Hyatt™ Seoul’s
General Manager Adrian Slater.


   In celebration of Grand Hyatt™ Seoul’s new mobile app, the hotel will hold a special
promotional event, “Staycation of Your Dreams”, during the month of
September.  All guests who install or
share the app via Facebook, Twitter or Instagram will be eligible to participate
in a lucky drawing for a luxury experience at Grand Hyatt™ Seoul, including a one-night stay in a Grand Suite
King, dinner buffet for two at The Terrace and a treatment for two at The Spa Grand Hyatt™ Seoul.
