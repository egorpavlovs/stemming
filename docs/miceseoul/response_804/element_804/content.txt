JW Marriott
Dongdaemun Square Seoul announced that it will launch the luxury bingsu ‘Dom
Perignon Bingsu’.

 

The Dom Perignon Bingu uses sorbet 100% made with Dom Perignon 2004 as a
topping with white peach salad with fresh mint, Yuzu compote, gold dusted
chocolate ring, and edible flower, creating a perfect balance of taste and
aesthetics. 

 

The Dom Perignon Bingsu is
priced at 75,000 won (tax inclusive), and two glasses of Dom Perignon can be
added for 60,000 won. The Dom Perignon Bingu is available at The Lounge, which
is located in the hotel lobby.

 

The world’s most renowned champagne, Dom Perignon, is produced when the
harvest is ideal and in exceptional vintage years only. Furthermore, it is
produced according to the Cuvee method, which only presses the grapes once, delivering
toasty aromas of bread and sweet and fresh hints of fruits.
