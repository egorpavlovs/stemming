								The National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, Seoul (MMCA Seoul) opened in November 2013 in Samcheong-ro (also known as “Culture Street”). Located on the former grounds of the Sogyeokseo (a state Taoist temple), Jongchinbu (the Office of Royal Genealogy), Gyujanggak(royal library), and Saganwon (the Office of Censors) during the Joseon Dynasty, it was the site of the Armed Forces Capital Hospital and Defense Security Command following the Korean War(1950-1953). With its own rich history, the MMCA Seoul is located in a modern center of cultural and political activity.As an art and culture complex with a Digital Library, Multi-Project Hall, and movie theater (MMCA Film and Video) within an exhibition and education facility, theMMCA Seoul offers visitors the chance to experience a variety of culture and arts genres (exhibitions, movies, performances, education, etc.) through which they can see the flow of contemporary art at a glance. Surrounded by a yard, the MMCA Seoul harmonizes with the former Defense Security Command and Jongchinbu buildings. Visitors can also appreciate a distant view of Inwangsan Mountain, which is featured in Gyeomjae Jeong Seon’s Inwangjesaekdo.
