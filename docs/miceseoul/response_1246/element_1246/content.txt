		73rd Skål World Congress to get a taste of Seoul
		2012-09-13
		
			
			Seoul will be serving up the very best of traditional Korean and international cuisine as part of the regular Skål ‘Dine Around’ event during next month’s 73rd Skål World Congress. This year’s Dine Around, designed as a night out on the town, will give visiting delegates the options to try a royal Korean banquet, Buddhist temple cuisine, signature Italian favorites and more in the city’s popular Insa-dong cultural district.The annual congress, set for October 2-7, will bring to Seoul several hundreds top travel industry professionals from across the globe, including hotel managers, CEOs of travel agencies, and tourism and convention bureau heads among others. The event will take place at two of Seoul’s major hotels, the Grand Hyatt Seoul and Grand Hilton Seoul.For ‘Dining Around’, which takes place on the evening of October 4th, congress attendees can choose from eight of Seoul’s most popular restaurants in Insa-dong, a district famous for its celebration of Korean culture, traditional Korean buildings and modern art galleries. Those looking to experience ancient Buddhist temple cuisine, which in recent years has become increasingly popular with visitors, can do so at Sanchon, owned and operated by a former Buddhist monk. San Ne Ri, a restaurant located within a traditional Korean house, will offer diners a truly dynastic experience.Meanwhile those in search of the royal treatment should look no further than Chon, Gogung and Hwangwho Samgyetang, the latter venue specializing in the popular local steamed chicken dish served with ginseng and garlic. Other specializing restaurants on the list include Doo Dae Mun, renowned for its grilled short ribs, the self-explanatory Tofu Restaurant, and Andamiro, an all-Italian option for those preferring a taste of the Mediterranean.Seoul was selected to host the 73rd Skål World Congress in 2010. In preparation for the event, the Seoul Convention Bureau assisted visiting International Skal Council President Bent Hadler with his inspection of the city’s infrastructure.The SCB will also be providing delegates the Seoul Welcome Kit, which offers international business tourists discounts in major meetings and entertainment businesses across Seoul, and a welcome message at Incheon International Airport. Skål International was also offered the assistance of the Seoul Convention Supporters, a pool of skilled event professionals.The Skål World Congress is organized by Skål International, a professional organization of global tourism leaders and the only one to unite all branches of the travel and tourism industry. Skål International is the largest association of its kind with 500 branches and 25,000 members representing 125 countries.
