								Declared "the most beautiful museum in Seoul" by CNN Travel, the Korea Furniture Museum consists of ten traditional Korean houses and a main exhibition hall (3 levels). Established in 1993, the museum possesses more than 2,000 pieces of antique Korean furniture and 500 of these are displayed in a permanent exhibition hall.
The museum has also hosted a variety of events for government agencies as well as international institutions and companies. Examples include a special luncheon for spouses of G20 leaders during the 2010 Seoul G20 Summit, a launching show for the Audi A6, a Lang Lang piano concert and a special luncheon for Chinese President Xi Jinping and his spouse First Lady, Peng Liyuan, hosted by President Park Geun-hye.
The museum is located about 10 minutes from the city center near the embassy district.
