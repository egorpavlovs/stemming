Grand Ambassador
Seoul is holding the 4th Blanc Bleu Hotel Art Fair from 18th
December (Friday) until 20th (Sunday). In this art fair, where the
Grand Ambassador Seoul is the organizer while Daehan Jeollam is the host, not
only the famous veteran artists in Korea such as Wang Yeol, Jang An-sun, Yu
Hang-mi, Han Myeong-il, Ju Hong-mi, etc but also rookies, and even teenager
artists will be participating. Therefore, in total 120 participants,
superseding generations, will display their art.

 

In the Hotel Art
Fair, where one can encounter art at a unique space, a hotel guest room instead
of the general exhibition hall, it is ever more meaningful since artists will
be greeting the visitors and sharing their feelings. Furthermore, this time a
sweepstake event, where round trip flight tickets to Europe and tickets for
hotel stay at overseas etc., is to be provided. Also, every day through raffle
souvenirs will be given away.

 

The profit raised
from the entry fee to the art fair and sales of artwork will be donated to
‘Plan Korea’ to be used for alleviating the poverty of children and for their
protecting their rights all over the world.. The exhibition will start from 10
AM and close at 9 PM, and you can view the pieces at the 5th, 6th,
and 7th floor guest rooms. The entry fee is KRW 10,000, and it is
free for the members of the hotel’s membership program.

                                                                                                                

One hotel staff
stated, “An even larger art fair has been organized according to the hotel’s 60th
anniversary. For customers, the opportunity to spectate various artworks will
be provided while for artists, it will provide a communication platform with
the public.” Also, the staff noted, “The event will be even more meaningful because
the profit will be used for donation. I hope people will participate and raise
their cultural sensibility.”
