EXPERIENCE THE MAGIC OF CHRISTMAS

AT MILLENNIUM SEOUL HILTON 

 

11 November 2015, Seoul, Korea… It’s getting to be that
time of year again – and to help spread Christmas spirit and Yuletide joy to
everyone in Seoul, Millennium Seoul Hilton is hosting a variety of Christmas
events!

 

Millennium Seoul Hilton’s Christmas season officially kicks off
with the unveiling of the Christmas Tree and ever-popular Christmas Train on
Saturday, November 23.  This year marks
the twentieth anniversary of this holiday tradition.

 

For the last two decades, every year a
grand 10-meter Christmas Tree stands tall in the center of the main lobby to
welcome guests to Millennium Seoul Hilton and warm people’s hearts with
Christmas cheer.  In the Lower Lobby,
designers and engineers skillfully recreate a miniature village in the Alps,
complete with snow-capped mountains, tunnels, wooden bridges and hot air
balloons.  The highlight, of course, for
both children and adults who are young at heart, is the Christmas Train, a
collection of around 75 exquisitely handcrafted locomotives and railroad cars
that will chug their way through the little village.  

 

The Christmas Train represents a
time-honored tradition at Millennium Seoul Hilton.  Now celebrating its twentieth year, the
unveiling of the Christmas Train marks, for many, the start of the Christmas
season, much like the Macy’s Thanksgiving Parade does in New York.   The spirit of Christmas is also remembered
as domestic and international companies are invited to sponsor railroad
cars.  All proceeds are then distributed
to Hyeshimwon Orphanage.  The Christmas
display will stay up for public viewing until January 17, 2016.

 

The Candy House will also be unveiled on
November 23, 2015.  This adorable shop
will not only feature sweet treats that are perfect for indulging in over the
holidays, but also Christmas gift and decoration items.  The Candy House will be open until December
26, 2015.

 

Looking for a special way to impress your
date on Christmas Eve or celebrate Christmas with your family?  How about an unforgettable meal at one of Millennium
Seoul Hilton’s acclaimed restaurants: Seasons for gourmet French cuisine; Il
Ponte for classic Italian favorites; Café 395 for All Day Dining or
Market-to-Table Open-Kitchen-style Buffet; Genji for sublime Japanese
delicacies; and Taipan for exciting Chinese specialties.  Each of the above restaurants will offer
special Christmas lunch and dinner specials perfect for holiday celebrations.

 

And to say goodbye to 2015 and welcome the
new year with style, join us for a New Year’s Eve Countdown Party at Oak Room,
the hotel’s English-style bar.

additional information, please call Millennium Seoul Hilton’s Food &
Beverage Department at (02) 317-3012.
