        As interest in food culture is increasing among customers, ‘The Skyfarm’ has planned this new brand to spread the lifestyle that focuses on fundamental materials, agriculture, food and coexistence with farmers. Farm-to-Table Diningplex, The Skyfarm consists of four places: a dining brand ‘Sadaebu Koggan’, ‘The Koggan’, ‘All the Morning’ (Semoa) and ‘The Promenade’ at 50th floor located in The Federation of Korean Industries Building. ‘Sadaebu Koggan’ is trying to continue the spirit of Ban-ga (noble family of Chosun Dynasty), treating the guest with the most valuables. We serve ‘Bansang’ which is well-balanced meal consisting of rice, soup, main dish and various side dishes. ‘The Koggan’ is a Korean Art Cuisine that pursuits philosophy and aesthetics of Sadaebu (nobility of Chosun Dynasty) with Korean cuisine expert, Jongguk Lee and conceptualized ‘feast on top of cloud’ meaning with spreading beautiful landscape of the 50-story. Moreover, this place is awarded as 2 stars of Michelin guide 2017 and 2018 Seoul. ‘All the morning (Semoa)’ is all day dining to fill the day with hearty menus cooked with fresh vegetables and local ingredients. Seems like every morning of the world has brought into one place, variety of brunch menu, salads, sandwiches, pasta, steak and wine are available. ‘The Promenade’ is a bespoke function hall where customers can constitute menus and space as they desire. Unlike traditional banquet or buffet, menus can be selected from Korean cuisine, American style to semi buffet cooked with seasonal ingredients, to meet customer needs. Also, as atrium space can be decorated for variety of banquet, party, meeting and wedding, this place makes things even more special with loved ones.TransportationFrom Incheon Int’l Airport: 40~50 MinutesSubway Station: 5 minutes walk from exit number 1&2 of subway line 5&9, Yeouido StationNearby Hotels and AttractionsWithin 3km: Courtyard by Marriott Hotel, Conrad Hotel, Hotel the Designers, Glad Hotel, Benikea Premier HotelWithin 5km: Best Western Premier Seoul Garden, Sheraton Seoul DcubecityStreets: Yonjung-roShopping: IFC MallParks : Yeouido Hangang Park, Yeouido ParkOthers: 63city, 63 Square, National Assembly of KoreaFACILITIESName of HallLocationSize(㎡)StandingSeatedPromenade50F274.65250150Sky Garden51F1171.89250100Glass House52F49.535020Special FeaturesMulti Dining Complex with modern interior design, high ceiling and wide windowPanoramic view offering clear view of Yeouido town & Han-river from 50th, 51st fl.Premiem Catering service of Western & Korean menu, served by Michelin 2 Star restaurant, The KogganPrivate rooms for business and small gatheringsBespoke function for small, big event as well as indoor, outdoor eventMajor EventsBrand and Product Lunching Party (2015 Shiseido Cherry Blossom)Dinner for foreign dignitaries and Prime Minister (2016 Korea CPO Forum, 2017 Asian Business Summit Gala Dinner)2017 Thanks Dinner for Netherland hero of Korea War2017 Parsons Design School Alumni NigntDrama/Movie/CF filming (2017 Drama W, Music Video)Press Interview for Korea CelebVarious corporation event, Gala Dinner, Fashion Show, Catering
