        The Korea Furniture Museum (KOFUM) provides a Korean cultural experience  for dining and other events in a compound of 10 traditional Korean houses (hanok).  With a collection of more than 2,000 pieces of traditional Korean antique furniture  dating from the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910), KOFUM provides one of the most comprehensive  and panoramic views of traditional Korean culture. Taking more than 14 years to complete, KOFUM officially made its debut as  the most beautiful museum in Seoul in November 2011, and only a year later was  granted the number one spot on CNN Online’s “13 things you've got to do in  Seoul” list.Located within Seoul’s Seongbuk district, KOFUM actively reinterprets traditional  Korean culture for the 21st Century.
