Grand Hyatt Seoul J.J. Mahoney’s

Greet 2016, Year of the Monkey, at “Monkey Zoo 322
@ JJ’s”  Halloween Party



Grand Hyatt Seoul’s center of
total entertainment, J.J. Mahoney’s is introducing a brand new party theme to
celebrate Halloween. J.J. Mahoney’s was the first in Korea to start the trend
of Halloween celebrations, and continues its party leadership with this latest
chapter in its popular party zoo concepts, building on its past party themes of
penguin, zebra, rabbit and cat zoos .

This year JJ. Mahoney’s will
be celebrating its 28th annual Halloween party with a Monkey Zoo in
honor of 2016, Year of the Monkey, and the monkey’s rule as icon of the jungle.
 As you enter the party area, you’ll be
immersed in a world of make believe, with the staff all dressed up in their  Halloween costumes, with the venue covered in jack-o’-lanterns,
maple trees, night owls, all on a canvass of red.  Guests are invited to search for the hidden
monkey hiding in the dance hall jungle.  The evening will be filled with entertainment,
including performances by a renowned DJ and live music by J.J.’s house band ‘ENCORE’’.  The highlight of the Halloween party will be
the crowning of the winner in the best costume contest, as Halloween rules the
night.  If you arrive unprepared for the
party, that’s OK because we will have a Halloween makeover booth ready to transform
you into your Halloween face of choice. 
To start the evening, take advantage of our complimentary welcome drink,
and be sure and stick around for our lucky draw event, with chances to win
great prizes. J.J. Mahoney’s Halloween
party will be held over a period of four great party days, including October 23rd,
24th, 30th, 31st.  Admission will be KRW 30,000 on October 23rd
& 24th, and KRW 50,000 on October 30th & 31st.(inclusive
of tax). For further information please contact 02-799-8601/2.
