								There is a Korean proverb that says, "Close neighbors are brothers and visitors from faraway places are friends". Our National Souvenir Center sells products with a belief that providing warm hospitality to neighbors and visitors as intimate beings is a human duty. Korean traditional cultural goods contain the “warmth and soul of Koreans”. The products have been made, sparing no effort, with a view to sharing a sincere heart. Revenues from the sales go to small- and medium-scale “minor” businesses that have well-preserved traditional culture.
We introduce products made in Korea with confidence and in accordance to our conviction that we should present the best things to visitors who come to our home.
