Top Brand Show in Korea, Comic Martial Arts Performance
JUMP 

JUMP is internationally acclaimed comic martial arts
sensation combines comedy, acrobatics and live action based on Korean martial
arts, Tae-kwon-do and other Asian martial arts. It entertains all ages in the
world with funny story and gravity defying movement without language barrier.

Seen and well-reviewed by over 6.5 million people in more
than 160 cities of 90 countries including West End in London, Broadway in New
York, National Tour in China and so on, JUMP won Sell-Out Show & Comedy
Award at Edinburgh Fringe Festival and had the privilege of the first
invitation as an Asian performance to the Royal Variety Show hosted by the
British royals and BBC.

It’s a story of one very unusual family of which all
members are martial arts experts, and two clumsy burglars who unluckily break
into this house. Incredible display of acrobatic and martial arts skills, with
a healthy dose of slapstick humour have you on the edge of your seat, rolling
on the floor, laughing and cheering for more! Imagine ‘Charlie Chaplin meets
Jackie Chan’, it is JUMP !

JUMP performs every day at JUMP THEATRE 5~20 mins
walk-neighboring sightseeing and shopping; Myeongdong, Gwanghwamun, Insadong,
City Hall, Cheonggyecheon, NamsanHanokmaeul, Dongdaemun etc.
