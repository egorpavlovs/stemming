The Oil Tank Culture Park is now ready for its grand
opening as a cultural complex and as a landmark of Seoul. The park was an oil
storage site for the past 41 years. At the west wing of Seoul World Cup
Stadium, near the foot of Mt. Maebongsan, five oil tanks, designated as a first
class security installation, were buried and strictly off-limits to ordinary
citizens.
The five existing tanks were reborn as spaces for performances, exhibits and
the like. A newly constructed tank became a community center, while the wide
outdoor space that had been the temporary parking lot became a courtyard to
host cultural events. The space was designed so that city residents could relax
there and various communities could make use to it.
The old oil tanks, a disused industrial facility, reopened as “Oil Tank Culture
Park,” a special, sustainable eco-culture space for the public, one that
preserves the historic significance of the site.
