        The RAUM is more than just a building; it is a forum that allows its patrons 
to expand their personal networks as well as being a culture and arts space. 
Designed by TRAUM HAUS Co., Ltd., the RAUM is the ultimate venue for exquisite 
performances, exhibitions, and banquets. Opened in 2011, the building took three 
years to complete and stands four stories high, with a total floor space of 
33,000m².
Its facilities include five banquet halls, each with their own style and 
modern amenities. Outside is a 1,300m² garden perfect for hosting parties 
and other social events in good weather.
