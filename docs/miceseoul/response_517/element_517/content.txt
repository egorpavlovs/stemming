        Villa de Bailey, a house wedding and party venue that is both exotically splendid
and relaxing like a vacation retreat, features two unique halls: the Oriental Banquet
Hall connected to a poolside garden and a Classic Banquet Hall that offers a classy
ambience. Villa de Bailey is capable of operating sophisticated banquets through
highly qualified services provided by professional and delicate arrangements that
