								Combining Seoul’s fascinating blend of Old World tradition and new-wave cool, Four Seasons Hotel Seoul brings the Four Seasons experience to Korea for the first time. Steps from the city’s most venerable historic sites and neighborhoods yet entrenched in the modern central business district, Four Seasons Seoul combines form and function with modernized Korean motifs to create an architecture that is proudly contemporary in design and unashamedly forward-thinking in spirit. Ensconced within this unique space are 317 guest rooms and suites ? each a private sanctuary of calm ? as well as seven exciting restaurants and bars where Seoul comes to eat, drink and mingle.Also, our Hotel offers 2,196 square meters of flexible meeting spaces. Two glamorous and modern ballrooms accommodate any event, from red-carpet galas to prestigious corporate conferences, while six light-filled meeting rooms are equipped with comprehensive technological support to accommodate the most demanding presentations or communications requirements.
