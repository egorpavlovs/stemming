				Bus
				Seoul's public bus system is well-developed, cheap, and a convenient form of transportation. All buses are color coded: blue buses connect the outer areas to the inner city, green buses connect subway stations to nearby residential areas, maeul (local) buses travel around small areas, yellow buses travel in a circulation route around the central parts of the city, and red buses connect the city with surrounding areas. However, due to the lack of English signs and information at bus stops, Seoul's buses can be more difficult to use for first time travelers to Korea.
