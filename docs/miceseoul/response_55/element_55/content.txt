			Korea’s Palace: Gyeongbokgung Palace
			
			Built in 1395, the location of the palace was determined based on the principles of feng shui, having Mt. Bukaksan to the back and Yukjo Street to the front along with Gwanghwamun (gate). Further to the front stands Mt. Namsan and the Cheonggyecheon Stream flows through the area, making the location the best spot in terms of feng shui. Perhaps it was indeed because of the auspiciousness of the location, but the Choseon Dynasty reigned for more than 600 years.
