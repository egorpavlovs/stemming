		•"B-boy Kung", the famous
nonverbal B-boy performance held in the world's first B-boy theater, has been
upgraded to "Kung Festival"! 

•The purpose of "Kung
Festival" is to report the seriousness of school violence and to prevent
teenagers from the prevalent social phenomenon by suggesting the main theme:
Friendship and Reconciliation. The dynamic dancing and comic storyline performed
by the talented dancers of SJ Crew will drive you excited. Listen to the
"KUNG" sound (means "boom") made in your heart! The
friendship, reconciliation, and the energy of yongers
will touch your mind friendly and deeply as a universal language.

•We plan to constantly upgrade this
performance to provide the worldwide audience with the best contents in
quality. Also, we are staging "a traveling performance" for local
schools and social welfare facilities out of the B-boy theater.
