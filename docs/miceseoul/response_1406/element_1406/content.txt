		Scenes From Seoul – As Told By Its Visitors

New Seoul Convention Bureau Promotion Invites 2013 International Visitors To Share Their Photos
If you visited Seoul this year and have photos, the Seoul Convention Bureau wants to put them to good use. Such is the premise of Scenes From Seoul, a new social media promotion designed to highlight the city’s busy 2013 events calendar and tourism-related offerings. The promotion is open to both international residents who visited Seoul this year and expats currently residing in Korea.
To enter, entrants simply need to have participated in a meeting, convention, exhibition or other type of event held in the Korean capital. Alternatively, they can submit pictures of cultural experiences, tourism sites, or other places of interest in Seoul. Winning entries will be eligible for Amazon gift certificates worth up to USD $100 and used in the SCB’s forthcoming video, Scenes From Seoul, celebrating the highlights of convention year 2013.
The promotion uses social media as its base, with submissions conducted via third-party apps on Facebook. An official promotion video can also be seen on Youtube at http://youtu.be/Phbg-oBlAmU. It is the SCB’s fourth destination-marketing promotion to use social media since 2010. While previous such events have focused more upon introducing Seoul’s meetings infrastructure and tourism attractions, Scenes From Seoul is the first to invite participants to share already-existing experiences of Korea’s capital.
“The meetings industry is about people at the end of the day. It’s about people coming together for a common cause, making connections, and hopefully having a great time,” said Hong Jae Sun, Senior Director at Seoul Convention Bureau. “Scenes From Seoul is all about them and their memories of being part of events and contributing a little to our rich history. This is why we always say Seoul is Your Complete Convention City.”
Scenes From Seoul runs until November 29, with the winning entries announced on December 9. For more details, visit the official Seoul Convention Bureau Facebook page at www.facebook.com/miceseoul.

The SCB is in charge of international marketing and public relations for Seoul as a convention city.
Seoul Tourism Organization (STO) is a joint venture launched by the city and private enterprises in February 2008 with a core mission to promote Seoul as a convention and tourism.
