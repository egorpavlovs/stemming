			Introduction
Combining Seoul's fascinating blend of Old World tradition and new-wave cool, Four Seasons Hotel Seoul brings the Four Seasons experience to Korea for the first time. Steps from the city's most venerable historic sites and neighborhoods yet entrenched in the modern central business district, Four Seasons Seoul combines form and function with modernized Korean motifs to create an architecture that is proudly contemporary in design and unashamedly forward-thinking in spirit. Ensconced within this unique space are 317 guest rooms and suites – each a private sanctuary of calm – as well as seven exciting restaurants and bars where Seoul comes to eat, drink and mingle.
