		STO Relaunches and Welcomes a New Leader
		2018-05-28
		
			
			Seoul Tourism Organization Relaunches
and Welcomes a New LeaderPresident & CEO
Jae-sung Rhee Will Hold Post  as the Head of the
Seoul Tourism Organization for Three Years Jae-sung Rhee,
former executive vice president of the Korea Tourism Organization, was
appointed to become the first president and CEO of the Seoul Tourism
Organization. President and CEO Jae-sung Rhee graduated from the Department of
Spanish at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies and went on to receive his
doctorate from Kyung Hee University's Graduate School of Tourism. He worked at
the Korea Tourism Organization for 33 years from 1985 to 2017 and held the
position of director in every department within the organization (Director of
Management, Executive Vice President, Director of
International Tourism and Marketing, Director of Domestic Industrial Affairs,
and Director of Policy). With his hands-on experience and
expertise, leadership abilities, and global sensibility, Jae-sung Rhee is regarded as an expert
in the field of tourism.

 President Rhee officially joined the
Seoul Tourism Organization on April 23, 2018, a week before the group
officially relaunched under a different legal status on May 1, when it was
restructured from a public-private partnership and government-invested corporation
into a fully government-funded foundation. Now funded by the Seoul Metropolitan
Government, the Seoul Tourism Organization has been reestablished to
proactively respond to the rapidly changing tourism environment and promote
Seoul tourism in a way that achieves the public interest and reflects
professionalism and responsibility.

 As an organization that specializes in
city marketing, the Seoul Tourism Organization aims to bring more international
visitors to Seoul by increasing the city's competitiveness in terms of tourism
and MICE, as well as contribute to the economic development of Seoul through
the revitalization of tourism-related industries. Going forward, the Seoul
Tourism Organization is expected to strengthen its public function of promoting
and leading the continuous development of the tourism industry under the
direction of president and CEO Jae-sung
Rhee.
