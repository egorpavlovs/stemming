Three delicious, nutritious and fast course menus from Man Ho

Man Ho, the authentic Chinese restaurant
at JW Marriott Hotel Seoul, is serving three special lunch courses designed to
meet the needs of business diners until December 31. 

Course A features Buddha Jumps over the
Wall, Man Ho's healthy signature dish, plus rockfish fried with vegetables and
XO sauce, sea cucumber soup, and chicken stew with mushroom and ginseng, while
Course B includes fried sea cucumber and scallops with douchi sauce,
braised beef meatballs, and steamed toothfish and tofu. Course C consists of
rockfish and tofu soup seasoned with fragrant coriander, chicken fried with
chili, steamed oxtail, and egg sprinkled with seafood and scallops. 

The three course menus are designed to
