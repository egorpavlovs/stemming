The hidden mansion located in the midst of
Seoul city, La Vie Douce: is the residence of the chairman of Hanjin Film
Company where more than 200 films were produced in the past 40 years.

In 2013, La Vie Douce opened its doors. The large garden gives the atmosphere
of privacy. With a luxurious private concept, it resembles a European mansion
as the limestones cover the surrounding walls and coral bricks inside.

About 300 people can be accommodated, and the decoration of the entire mansion
can be restructured according to the needs of the private events, social
parties, and also wedding ceremonies and banquets.

Our Grand La Bene has a unique feature in its design to connect the inside and
out, the nature and the mansion. There are various rooms within the mansion and
also a private club, Club La Bene in the basement of the mansion.

La Vie Douce is able to provide a special event designed just for that one
special person.
