Seoul
Innovation Park is a platform for social innovation established in April 2015
and located at the northwest area in Seoul, near Bulgwang Subway Station. In
the past, the site had been used as Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
Seoul Innovation Park is the place where citizens find their possibility as
innovators, realize positive changes in daily lives and support each other. 

More than 250 groups and 1,200 innovators are carrying out diverse experiments
to make their imagination come true in various spaces including Future Field,
Project Path, Upcycling Heights, Maker Meadow, and Art Castle in the site of
100,000m 2.
