								We are a Destination Management Company which provides all travel services in Korea for foreigners.We have participated in various travel fairs around the world and have a good relationship with our local partners in more than 50 countries. We specialize particularly in services for Muslim travelers, attracting to Korea not only the Middle East travelers but also Muslim travelers from Asia. And recently, we opened a sale office in Malaysia also.As a MICE and VIP event specialist, we arranged ceremonies and performances for events organized by the United Nations for Mexico. We properly performed many events for Saudi's Arabia Royal Family, Singapore Foreign Minister's Family in Korea, and a tour for a Malaysian singer's fan club, in Korea.That is the reason why we received official praise letter from those parties.In addition, last year, we were registered as an excellent tourist agency designated by the Seoul Metropolitan Government, and it was once again a chance to be recognized for our good quality services. Etourism will continue to be a professional and friendly travel agency in the future. We will make all effort needed to bring a proud image of Korea to the world by attracting more foreigners through better service.
