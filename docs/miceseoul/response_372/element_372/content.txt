								Arumjigi Culture Keepers Foundation
Arumjigi House (Arumjigi head office building in Tongui-dong, Seoul) visualizes the foundational mission to sustain and uphold tradition with creativity. It features the harmonized combination of tradition and modernity through Korean beauty in architecture, clothing, and crafts which are beautifully presented in the house.
The inner spaces on the 1st floor are flexible to hold a variety of functions including exhibitions, lectures, seminars, performances, and other various cultural events. Arumjigi's main event is a special annual exhibition presented under three main themes- clothing, cuisine, and architecture. On the 2nd floor, there is a Korean traditional house in the inner yard which harmoniously resides with the office building and meeting room. The yard in the middle of the 2nd floor provides a beautiful linkage between the traditional and modern part the house while the modern furniture in the office reflects the aesthetics and proportions of traditional furniture.
Arumjigi believes Korean traditional aesthetics and approaches can shape new trends in contemporary times, and we hope our house will be a cultural platform to support experiences and products that introduce such Korean aesthetics to the world.
