		Seoul Partnership with University of Macau Promises Rewarding Educational Exchange
		2013-10-02
		
			
			The Seoul Tourism Organization has signed an MOU with the University of Macau designed to cultivate mutual educational exchanges on hospitality and business events beneficial to both sides. The signing took place on August 28th during the university’s 3rd Module of the Global Leadership Development Program (GLDP) series, which focused on ‘Hospitality and MICE: Strategy, Growth and Management’. Together, both STO and the University of Macau aim to continue their partnership in the education of hospitality and business events, with opportunities for future modules of the GLDP to return to Seoul.
The Seoul module was held at the Grand Hyatt Seoul Hotel from August 26-30, and focused on ‘Relationships and Reflective Mindset’. It was attended by 21 senior executives and professionals working in the tourism and hospitality industries both in Seoul and Macau.
According to Professor Jacky So, Dean of Faculty of Business Administration at the University of Macau, Seoul was a strategically-chosen destination for the University of Macau’s GLDP series,
“This program is specially designed for senior executives in Asia’s hospitality and MICE industries. Our goal is to nurture these executives to become globally competitive and socially responsible leaders of both hospitality and business events, and Seoul sets high standards in these areas that we can all learn from.”
The lecture series in Seoul featured presentations by Maureen O’Crowley, Vice-President of the Seoul Convention Bureau, and Professor Chulwon Kim, Dean of College of Hotel and Tourism Management, Kyung Hee University. Visiting guest speakers included Dr. John Leung, Associate Professor from Dept of Marketing at City University of Hong Kong, Professor Fong Ka Choi, Davis, Associate Professor of Hospitality & Gaming, Management at University of Macau, Leonard Achan, Senior Vice President and Chief Communications Officer at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City, and Brian To, Adjunct Faculty at Singapore Management University.
The new MOU is the most recent of Seoul’s ongoing efforts to establish and encourage international exchange programs in the field of business events. Last year, Kyung Hee University also joined the Seoul Tourism Organization in signing an MOU with the Thailand Convention & Exhibition Center and Hollym University. Taking place during the 2012 Korea MICE Expo, the MOU formalized an agreement to set up academic exchange programs for teachers and students of business events in both Seoul and Thailand.

Seoul Convention Bureau (SCB), a division of the Seoul Tourism Organization, is the official government-sponsored body representing and promoting the city overseas as a prime venue for meetings, conventions and exhibitions.  The SCB is in charge of international marketing and public relations for Seoul as a convention city.
Seoul Tourism Organization (STO) is a joint venture launched by the city and private enterprises in February 2008 with a core mission to promote Seoul as a convention and tourism.
