facility home to 40,000 sea creatures of over 650 different species in more
than 3,000 tons of water.For those seeking to throw a special event – be it a
company gathering or a private party, why not hold it in a place where you can
watch schools of fish swimming together in perfect unison? Coex Aquarium’s
event hall can make it happen.
