		Seoul Unveils New Campaign and Budget to Reinvigorate Seoul Tourism (STO Press Release)
		2015-07-14
		
			
			Seoul, South Korea, July 9, 2015 – Seoul has introduced a new campaign and series of initiatives as part of a 16 billion won supplementary budget in an all-out effort to revitalize Seoul’s tourism.
The new campaign, “Seoul, just in time for you!”, and a series of initiatives was introduced by mayor Park Won Soon on Thursday as part of the city’s full combined effort and strategy to revive the city’s tourism sector which has taken a hit from the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak.
Leading up to October, the city highlighted it would put an emphasis on showing its appreciation for returning visitors with an exceptionally warm reception and by making all efforts to go beyond meeting the expectations of visitors. This includes special discounts and deals that will be offered during upcoming events such as the ‘Seoul Summer Sale’ (through the month of July) and ‘Korea Grand Sale’ (August 28 through October 31). The city will also sponsor more public cultural and musical performances and host a series of monthly night markets that combines shopping and eating. In August, the first-ever ‘Seoul Bazaar’ is also slated to take place.
Abroad, Mayor Park will embark on a series of international tours over the next few months to China and Southeast Asia while simultaneously tourism advertisements in these regions will see a boost. During the tours, Park will participate in local events and help reestablish Seoul as a fun and safe destination. Negotiations are currently underway for the mayor to be joined by a top Korean celebrity on the tours, the city said.
The Seoul Metropolitan Government also pledged to meet with some 1,000 representatives from various fields of Seoul’s tourism sector to discuss ways to improve the city’s tourism industry.
Despite the recent downturn in visits, the city government expressed confidence in restoring its image and vowed to draw back visitors by turning the difficult period into an opportunity for Korea’s capital.
“Because of this recent MERS situation, the tourism industry experienced its most severe crisis but if we make efforts to sensibly overcome it, this can be a step for the Seoul tourism to make big reforms,” said Kim Eui Seung, Director-General of the Tourism & Sports Department at the Seoul Metropolitan Government. “We will put all efforts into reviving Seoul’s tourism industry.”
