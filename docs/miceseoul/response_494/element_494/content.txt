        Samwon Garden is a veteran of the local restaurant scene, first opening its 
doors in 1976 and quickly achieving fame for being not only Seoul’s largest 
restaurant, but a place serving quality and authentic traditional Korean cuisine. 
In 2011, the Michelin Green Guide to South Korea described Samwon Garden as 
“the single place to go for Korean-style beef.”
