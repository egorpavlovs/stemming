						Much more than skin-deep success

	Seoul’s technological prowess and huge reserves of expert manpower made sure that everything ran as smoothly as silk when the South Korean capital played genial host to the 22nd World Congress of Dermatology (WCD).

	The six-day event, held at the Coex Convention and Exhibition Center, was the largest medical gathering of its kind in the country’s history, attracting 12,000 participants from more than 110 countries.

	Organised by the International League of Dermatological Societies, WCD is held every four years and brings together physicians, exhibitors and trade press to examine developments in matters concerning the human skin.

	The congress occupied three of the Coex’s four exhibition and event halls, plus 23 of its meeting rooms (incidentally, an event of this size and complexity involved hiring more than 500 temporary staff through a headhunting company brought in by the local PCO, Koconex). Then some 200 computer screens were used to show ever-changing digital e-posters in place of paper versions.

	Delegates armed with smart phones took advantage of the Wi-Fi to download a special WCD 2011 application to keep them up to speed, while an optical mark recognition questionnaire system was used to generate feedback. All this technology ensured the Congress Daily was packed with the latest news, ideas and trends.

	The recently-formed Seoul MICE Alliance, representing most of the city’s convention specialists, pulled the right strings to block off the necessary first-class hotel accommodation demanded by such a complex event, according to Grace Kim from the Seoul Convention Bureau.

	Another major consideration was being able to offer international guests a range of downtime entertainment, as well as the chance to experience the cultural life of the host nation and its capital. How?

	Simple: the nation was brought to them, in miniature, with a special Korean Village erected in the Coex display hall. It featured three sections: one dedicated to traditional Korean instruments, a second exhibiting ancient Korean artifacts and a third where guests could try on hanbok – the country’s traditional clothing.

	There was a souvenir shop where delegates could sample Korean cuisine while a screen zone presented promotional AV programmes about the country.

	Meanwhile a thousand WCD participants enjoyed a standing banquet at Seoul Olympic Park featuring traditional performance theatre on a stage by the Han River.

	A colourful partner programme included art and craft demonstrations, temple experiences, kimchi and Korean rice-wine making, visits to the National Museum and the “Jewel in the Palace” theme park based on a national TV drama.

	Maureen O’Crowley, vice-president of the Seoul Convention Bureau said: “Feedback from delegates has been overwhelmingly positive. This massive event now occupies a major place in the city’s convention profile. It was particularly significant as Seoul is championing medical tourism as a major growth industry.”

	In 2010 Seoul’s conventions pedigree was illustrated by its handling of the 2010 G20 Summit. It will be looking forward to 2014 when it will welcome the World Congress of Internal Medicine and two years later the International Society of Hypertension.

	Little wonder, then, that South Korea’s capital now commands fifth spot in the Union of International Associations’ 2010 table of international meetings. And with the completion, of a convention centre and complex at the Seoul Station, the city aims to more than double its meetings capacity by 2015.
