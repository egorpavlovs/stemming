21 December 2015, Seoul, Korea… Oak Room, Millennium
Seoul Hilton’s traditional
English-style bar, will host a New Year’s Eve Countdown Party on December 31st.  Join other partygoers for the last party of
2015, and the first of 2016.  

 

Oak Room will offer special New Year’s
drink sets to help you celebrate.  With a
purchase of a bottle of champagne (Moet Chandon Imperial – KW200,000; Moet
Chandon Rose – KW250,000; or Dom Perignon – KW550,000), you will receive a
complimentary fruit or cheese platter!  

 

The Oak Room’s live band, a trio from the
Philippines called Night Birds, will perform all night, and when it is time to
ring in the new year, join the other partygoers in the exciting countdown to 2016.  Following tradition, the band will play Auld
Lang Syne, making this the perfect way to say goodbye to all things old and
welcome the new year and all its amazing possibilities with your friends.  

 

Start your new year’s resolutions early
this year and resolve to have fun and party it up at Oak Room’s New Year’s Eve
Countdown Party.

 

The Oak Room is a traditional
English-style bar with a log fire for cold winter nights, but also features a
patio garden with a breathtaking view to enjoy when the weather is just right
outside!  Offering a wide selection of
international beers and cocktails as well as a tempting menu, the Oak Room is
the perfect place to unwind after work with colleagues or enjoy a casual meal with friends and family.
