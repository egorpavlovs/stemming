SPOTLIGHT ON CANTONESE CUISINE AT TAIPAN

 

 

22 March
2016, Seoul, Korea… Taipan, Millennium Seoul Hilton’s Chinese restaurant,
is pleased to welcome two special guests from Grand Millennium Beijing from
March 23rd to April 3rd.  Chefs Liang Zong Can and Zhang Chuan Lei are
both seasoned chefs and will lend their culinary expertise to Taipan’s kitchen
during their stay.

 

Chef Liang specializes in Cantonese
cuisine, which is often referred to as China’s haute cuisine.  Chef Zhang specializes in Chinese
barbecue.   Both chefs will lend their experience and
creativity by introducing completely new, bold, and mouth-watering dishes to
Taipan’s menu, including various barbecued pork and chicken, and the ever
popular roasted duck. 

 

Cantonese cuisine originated out of
China’s Guangdong province and is one of the Eight Culinary Traditions of
Chinese cuisine. Spices are used modestly so that the flavours of the main
ingredients, which are fresh and high-quality, take center stage in Cantonese dishes.  

 

Enjoy this opportunity to experience the
splendours of Cantonese cuisines.

 

Taipan is renowned for its innovative
cuisine that showcases the complex flavors of China with its extensive a la
carte selection including seasonal delicacies. Taipan is set in an elegant
environment, and has private dining rooms that exemplify undisturbed
surroundings. Taipan means “Great
Leader” in Chinese and was the moniker of leading merchants engaged in trade
between China and India in eighteenth century Canton.  The merchant princes rose to unrivaled
prosperity on the surging wave of industrialization.  Over the years, the meaning of Taipan was
modified to represent progress and prosperity. 

 

 For reservations or
enquiries, please call Taipan
at (02) 317-3237.
The details of this event are subject to change.
