			Introduction
GLAD HOTEL YEOUIDO is a global hotel brand for smart travelers. Positioned between excessively luxurious standardized deluxe hotels and boutique hotels that focus too much on design, GLAD HOTEL YEOUIDO aims to become a new category of practical hotel.

You will readily find that common to all the amenities and services you encounter at GLAD HOTEL YEOUIDO will be the brand's core values of "practicality and friendliness." We re-designed the space by simulating the actual movements of our guests, and boldly did away with unnecessary elements from their viewpoint GLAD HOTEL YEOUIDO 's tone is courteous yet casual and engaging. To avoid the dull and impersonal atmosphere of a business hotel, we added the unique friendliness of GLAD HOTEL YEOUIDO to our design and service.
