        The 700 Yacht Club is Seoul’s first membership-based yachting club, with 
event spaces and boats that are also available to non-members. Popular events 
held at the club by the general public include the use of its yachts for rides, 
company product launches, team building yacht races, sunset barbecue cruises, 
and night cruises. Nighttime sailing after a sunset barbecue meal at the clubhouse 
has also proved very popular for companies and other groups using the facilities 
for meetings, events, and VIP entertainment. In addition, the 700 Yacht Club’s 
corporate regattas make ideal team building programs for corporate groups, with 
sailing lessons and yacht races held during the day, followed by a barbecue 
dinner and night cruises to round things off. The club’s special end-of-year 
parties, which also include sailing activities, are also very popular.
