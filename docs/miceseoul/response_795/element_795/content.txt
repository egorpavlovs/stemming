TIS THE SEASON AT MILLENNIUM SEOUL HILTON

 

13 November 2014, Seoul, Korea… The festive season is soon
approaching, and to help with your holiday celebrations, Millennium Seoul
Hilton is hosting a full line-up of special celebratory events.  From
special gourmet dinners to a spectacular Christmas tree and Christmas train
display (complete with a miniature Alpine village), you’ll have plenty of
activities to choose from to enhance your holiday festivities this
winter.  

 

On
Thursday, November 20th, Millennium Seoul Hilton will unveil its 10-meter-tall
Christmas Tree and ever-popular Christmas Train, a collection of over 120
exquisitely handcrafted locomotives and railroad cars that will chug their way
through an Alpine village of snow-capped mountains, tunnels, wooden bridges,
and hot air balloons.   This year marks the nineteenth anniversary of this holiday tradition.  The
Christmas tree and train will remain on display through to January 18th, 2015. 

 

Located
in the lower lobby of the hotel,
the Gingerbread House is a delightful and magical store where Christmas
shoppers can find the most delectable goodies and the perfect stocking stuffers
for the loved ones on their Christmas lists.  It’s open daily from 9 a.m. to 9.30 p.m. so stop by
the Gingerbread House from November 20th
 to December 26th and pick up that “just right”,
one-of-a-kind gift today!

 

On
Christmas Eve and Christmas Day
(December 24th and December 25th), Café 395, Oak Room (English-style
bar), Genji (Japanese restaurant), Il Ponte (Italian restaurant), Seasons
(French restaurant), and Taipan (Chinese restaurant) will all feature various
Dining Specials or Holiday Buffets to help you and your loved ones celebrate a
memorable Christmas meal. 

 

Other
end-of-the-year celebrations will also take place, including Seasons’ 77th Gourmet Circle, which
will take place on December 5th
and 6th.  Oak Room will host a New Year’s Eve Countdown Party on December 31, 2014.
