Seoul was actively represented and promoted at this year’s IMEX Frankfurt industry trade show, which was held from May 21-23 in Germany. Seoul Tourism Organization staffs were on hand to promote Korea’s capital to event attendees, as well as participate in the Politician’s Forum.
At IMEX Frankfurt, STO President and CEO Sung-Real Lee met with industry association leaders IMEX Chairman Ray Bloom and ICCA President Martin Sirk. Chairman Bloom spoke about Seoul’s participation in the upcoming IMEX Future Leaders Forum, which will take place during the Korea MICE Expo in Seoul this July. Meanwhile, President Sirk discussed with CEO Lee regarding strategies for the meetings industry development in knowledge-oriented economies, and noted Seoul’s successful efforts.

Lee also attended the Politician’s Forum on Wednesday May 22nd, which focused on ways in which the meetings industry can contribute to global economic recovery and growth..The program began with a networking breakfast with politicians and tourism industry leaders - including ministers and officials from the national to regional levels.
During a forum session regarding policy priorities President Lee addressed the floor regarding the power of meetings in achieving policies,
"I believe our industry, with its people to people exchange, has the ability to make breakthroughs on a different level and lay a foundation for both peace and prosperity. Close cooperation on the hosting of meetings represents just one stabilizing solution to co-existence that creates the desired economic benefit as well."
The forum closed with the signing of a new ‘Declaration of Support’, stating that the signatories understand the full economic importance of the meetings and events industry to their communities and highlight the industry’s role in building and sustaining social and economic growth.

Seoul itself was promoted extensively at booth B400, where IMEX attendees had the opportunity to meet with STO staff, along with 5 members of the Seoul MICE Alliance, an industry partnership of 113 major meetings industry-related businesses catering to international conferences, incentives, and exhibitions in Seoul. They included the Coex convention and exhibition center, the nearby Seoul Intercontinental hotels, and the three destination management companies Koridoor Tours, Plaza 21 Plus Travel, and Wow Corea Tour.
The South Korean capital was also prominently displayed in the June edition of Association Meetings International magazine, which was distributed at the IMEX show floor to buyers and attendees. The Seoul feature provided updates on Seoul’s ever-increasing MICE infrastructure and top spots for international conference delegates. There was also a meeting of the Future Convention Cities Initiative (FCCI), during which members met to seek new ways to develop the MICE industry.

IMEX Frankfurt is an annual international event, allowing the various sectors of the global meetings industry to network and promote the business eventscapabilities of their city, region, or country overseas. This was Seoul’s fifth attendance since the Seoul Tourism Organization opened its doors in 2008.
