		EurasTech, RH ISTC, Russian Trade Representation in Rep.of Korea To Hold INNOMED Conference on March 6th 

Seoul, Korea, January
20, 2015 -  As healthcare authorities in the world are trying to find
solutions to deliver the best quality medical services to population, medical
technology developers and equipment makers have
prepared various cost-effective ways to overcome existing issues with the help
of high-tech and innovations. 

 

On March 6
Eurastech Corp. and RH ISTC supported by Russian Trade Representation in Korea
will hold the 1st INNOMED conference devoted to emerging trends
in Korean and Eurasian medicine and healthcare technologies in Seoul. Organized
at, by far, the best convention venue – COEX – the conference will attract
dozens of Russian, CIS and Korean business representatives, officials and
outstanding scholars to discuss and share innovative technologies in healthcare
industry. 

 

High population
growth, increased life expectancy coupled with high mortality rate and ageing,
prevalence of lifestyle related diseases and aspiration of high quality
healthcare is putting pressure on healthcare providers to be more innovative
and invest in providing high quality care and integrated services and
equipment. Although healthcare challenges can vary from region to region, health
systems of every type around the world have the same objective: to finance and
deliver the highest possible quality of care to the maximum number of people at
the lowest possible cost.

 

 Having
this in mind, the InnoMED ( Innovative Medicine and Healthcare Technologies)
Conference aims to provide innovative strategies to improve the quality of
healthcare delivery whilst reducing costs and assessing the latest medical and
management technologies for improving public and patient medical and
healthcare. The conference will bring all medicine and healthcare stakeholders
together including healthcare leaders from health authorities, technological companies;
providers from both the government and private sector, public policymakers and
investors.  

 

Keynote speech
representing The New generation of Doppler ultrasound technologies  will
be delivered by Dr. E. Bogdanov, MD, PhD  in Medicine, Phd In Economics from
Peter the Great St.Petersburg State PolytechnicUniversity. Other speakers
are Dr Timur Atabaev, PhD and Assistant Professor at National University of
Uzbekistan,  Dr.Andrey Toropovskiy, MD, PhD  and CEO of Testgene from
Ulianovsk – birthplace of Vladimir Lenin. Korean side will be represented by
scholars from Dongguk University and others. 

 

Among InnoMed visitors
more than 100 leading medical research institutions, key enterprises –buyers of
medical equipment from Europe, CIS, Korean and overseas medical associations,
healthcare officials, technology experts and South Korean producers of advanced
medical equipment are expected.  

 

"The Innomed
is the first Korean-Eurasian conference of its kind," stated
EurastechCorp. CEO Elizabeth Lee. "We organize this forum to give
companies, hospitals and public organizations a viable way to provide
high-quality healthcare services using most up-to-date technologies and making
new connections in medical industry that would build new export-import
opportunities and technology transfer leads. Our guests will be able not only
to get in touch with advance know-how and visit KIMES exhibition, but also
participate in B2B matchmaking program and eventually find new business
partners.EurasTech is a
