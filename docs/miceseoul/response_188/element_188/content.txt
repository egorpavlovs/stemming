								World’s first AR Museum“Take the courage test and go near the erupting volcano with its boiling lava raging through earth cracks and black smoke turning sky dark. Explore sea bottom and watch a beautiful mermaid wave at you with her tail, and one step away a fire breathing water dragon from legends is waiting for you!” With the use of augmented reality technology Trick Eye artworks have become more realistic than ever. Trick Eye Museum is the world’s first museum to apply AR technology to artworks, now offering even more mind bending experience to its customers
