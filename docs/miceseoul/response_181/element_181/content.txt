								The innovative non-verbal performance, Ballerina Who Loved a B-boy, as the name suggests, combines ballet with street dance. Whether young or old, male or female, Ballerina Who Loved a B-boy releases the viewer from all social barriers, giving them a sense of camaraderie with their fellow spectators and making them realize they are part of a much greater whole. The unique performance helps all find that which resides within, and the awakening of an inexhaustible energy.
The non-verbal performance is easily accessible to international visitors and has been seen all over the world. At the Edinburgh Fringe Festival it was declared the best of the 2,050 entries in 2007. Its successful long run of 40 days and 50 shows on Broadway in 2008 prompted Broadway promoters to invite it back for a permanent run in the Time Square theater district.
