        The National Hangeul Museum (NHM) was opened on October 9, 2014 to promote and disseminate the linguistic and cultural
value of the Korean language, Hangeul, the most valued treasure of Korea’s heritage.
NHM is dedicated not only to preserving and sharing the value of Hangeul but also in expanding and creating new uses for
the language through the convergence of diverse fields. In addition, the museum is planning to create opportunities for a
wide variety of exchanges by expanding the cooperative network of linguistic museums around the world.
The museum’s annex building consists of four separate rooms that can be combined as one large space. The front garden of
the museum can hold events up to 200 people and stretches out to the peaceful and leisurely Yongsan Family Park.
