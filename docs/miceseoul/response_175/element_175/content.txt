								‘Fanta-Stick’ is the only live music performance where you can feel the powerful heart-beating rhythm of percussion and the heart-filling melodiesof Korean traditional music all at once. Rhythmical percussion sounds, breathtaking performances, remarkable traditional melodies, and a beautifullove story will keep you thrilled throughout. Unique integration of Korean traditional instruments and percussion will give you an unforgettableexperience. It is a golden opportunity for you to be infected by a fun virus. It is more than whatever you have imagined.SynopsisIn the beginning, there were a man and a woman who loved each other. God loved them so much that he gave a Heavenly drum to the man and a Heavenly flute to the woman. But the woman tore off the Heavenly drum because the man got obsessed by the Heavenly drum. As a result, God hid the Heavenly flute and made her family become ghosts. The only way to turn back into human is to play ‘Fanta-Stick’ music with the lost heavenly flute. Guess what will happen to them next?※ Outside performance is also possible.Time: Monday ?
