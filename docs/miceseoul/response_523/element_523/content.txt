        Opened in 1984, Seoul Grand Park consists of Seoul Zoo, the largest one in Korea, caring for 3700 animals from 330 species,
Seoul Land, an amusement park, Rose Garden and Children’s Zoo in Theme Garden, and Campsite. Seoul Grand Park is set
among forested hillsides and a perfect place for relaxation as a comprehensive theme park.
Since animals and plants of Changgyeong Park, opened in 1909, moved to Seoul Zoo, we have pursued happiness among
animals, people and nature under the catchphrase of three Donghang - Donghang (動幸) that animals are happy, Donghang
(動行) that animals’ behaviors are free, and Donghang (同行) that people and animals go together.
We provide diverse activities for families and friends such as educational program, feeding activities, African festival, and the
largest rose garden festival in Korea. We pursue citizens’ happiness through distinctive festivals and cultural activities.
Seoul Grand Park will continue its effort to help animals and people be happy, and to achieve the goal of being a world-class
cultural park.
