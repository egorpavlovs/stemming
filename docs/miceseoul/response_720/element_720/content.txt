		Nationwide local food festival
 
Rich food festival wherein all types of representative local foods from respective regions nationwide can be enjoyed in one place 
 
To celebrate autumn, the harvest season, Novotel Ambassador will hold the “Nationwide Local Food Festival” wherein representative local foods from respective regions nationwide can be enjoyed in one place at The SQUARE buffet restaurant in Gangnam. 
 
Representative local dishes prepared from the festival include: healthy small octopus Yeonpotang, which uses ingredients in season, and sour, chewy, seasoned skate ray from Jeolla-do; Chodang Sundubu (tofu stew) from Gangneung, the representative region of Gangwon-do, and Abai Sundae (pig intestines), a regional specialty of Sokcho; delicious Dombe Gogi (meat) from Jeju-do; Olgaengyiguk, a soup with rich taste from Chungbuk Goesan; Dongnae Pajeon (seafood pancake), which is full of seafood from Busan; soft and crispy Bulgogi in Eonyang style; and North Korean-style Gajami Sikhye (rice juice) made from cooked millet.
 
[The SQUARE] boasts of a classy black and white interior designed in part by world-renowned interior design company Wilson Associate. In particular, there are 7 live open kitchen corners where live cooking is done in different concepts, including the grill corner, pasta corner, and sushi corner, all of which have been especially praised by visitors. A floor-to-ceiling wall is filled with bottles of wine. The place can accommodate groups of people from as few as 8 to as many as 45; thus serving as the perfect venue for private events such as family parties or gatherings of various sizes.
