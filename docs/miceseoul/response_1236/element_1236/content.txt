								Since it was founded in 33 years ago, the Korean Society of Sports Medicine has sought to promote the value of sports medicine by supporting both the academic development and increase of medical professionals in the field at a national level. Today, the society boasts almost 2,000 members and continues to grow qualitatively as well as quantitatively in pursuit of its mission.In recent times, sporting activities have become recognized as a growth industry that enhances national prestige, added value to local businesses and the health industry, and enhances the quality of life. This in turn has led to an increase in the leisure sports population and a corresponding rise in sports-related injuries.To compensate for this, the Korean Society of Sports Medicine aims to revitalize each industry subcommittee, computerize the industry journal, make its activities transparent, and increase the domain of its members to pursue active involvement.International EventsThe Society endeavors to highlight the Korean sports medicine field by attracting international events. In 2017, it will host two major global conferences in Korea for those interested in sports medicine:1. 2017 IOC World Conference on Prevention of Injury and Illness in Sport2. 2017 IOC Advanced Team Physician Course
