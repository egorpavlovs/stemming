		JW Marriott Hotel Seoul is to launch the
“Evening Picnic Package,” the ideal way to combine a hotel break with a
relaxing picnic by Seoul’s Hangang River. The package is available until November 30. 

The Evening Picnic Package offers one
night’s accommodation in a Superior Room and a stylish environmentally friendly
canvas bag containing a tumbler and blanket featuring the JW Marriott logo,
making the ideal autumn picnic kit. Guests choosing the package will also be
offered a KRW 10,000 voucher for use at the Deli Shop, where a range of
delicious breads, cakes, salads, coffees and other homemade goods is available.
The package includes complimentary admission to the JW Marriott Hotel Seoul
Fitness Club, the largest of its kind in Asia, and recently refurbished
environmentally friendly swimming pool complex. It is priced at KRW 269,000 (plus tax and service charge). 

Banpo Hangang Park, located just 10
minutes’ walk from the hotel, is the perfect place to enjoy a riverside picnic.
The local area also boasts plenty of other great walking options, including
Banpocheon Stream, Seoripul Park and Montmartre Park.
