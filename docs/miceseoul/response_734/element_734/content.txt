The Ritz-Carlton, Seoul
presents 'Berry More Teassert'

The Ritz-Carlton, Seoul is set to launch “Berry More Teassert,” a celebration of seasonal strawberries available from January 9 to May
1, 2016. 

Berry More Teassert features only the finest strawberries, selected for
superior sweetness, offering a sensational experience of Korea's favorite
spring fruit. The promotion includes some 30 dishes, with desserts such as crêpes
with strawberries and fresh cream, strawberry macarons, strawberry rolls and
ice cream, as well as sandwiches salads, chocolate fondu, scones, chungmu
gimbap (mini-rice rolls in roasted seaweed), and seasonal fruit. The food menu
is accompanied by 10 varieties of black tea from premium German teahouse
Ronnefeldt, recommended and served by a tea expert. 

Berry More
Teassert will be served every Saturday and Sunday at The Ritz Bar, in two
sittings. The first sitting takes place from noon until 14:30, and the second
from 15:00 to 17:30. The promotion is priced at 53,000 won per person
(including tax and service charge). 

The Ritz Bar
offers a classical and refined atmosphere based on the concept of a traditional
English study. Lined and divided with bookshelves, it boasts an ambience ideal
for private gatherings, informal meetings and other events.
