TRUFFLE AND PASTA:

A HEAVENLY COMBINATION AT IL PONTE

 

22 February 2016, Seoul, Korea… Il Ponte, Millennium
Seoul Hilton’s popular Italian trattoria, will host a special promotion
featuring magnificent truffle and pasta creations.  For the entire month of March, diners will be
able to choose from incredible a la carte options as well as a special Set
Menu.  

 

The a la carte options will include:
Ravioli stuffed with Taleggio Cream and Black Truffle Foam (KW31,000);
Fettuccini with Salted Anchovies, Black Truffle and Grated Parmesan (KW33,000);
Homemade Ricotta and Potato Dumpling with Green Zucchini Pesto and Shaved Black
Truffle (KW35,000) and Saffron Risotto with Green Asparagus, Black Truffle and
Olive Tapenade (KW33,000).  

 

The special set menu is priced at KW85,000
and will include the following mouthwatering dishes: Scallop marinated with
Extra Virgin Olive Oil and Lemon, Black Truffle and Rocket Salad; Light
Asparagus Cream Soup; a choice of Homemade Truffle Pasta with Duck Ragout or
Beef Tenderloin wrapped in Prosciutto Ham with Green Asparagus and Potato
Gnocchi; to end the evening on a sweet and high note - Black Forest Tiramisu on
Berries Compote.  

 

Whether you’re dining a la carte or
choosing the set menu, you’ll become intoxicated by the sublime fragrance of
truffles, known as “the diamonds of the kitchen” in the culinary world. Found
mostly in Europe, truffle varieties are also found in North Africa, North
America, and the Middle East.  Known for
their high price and aphrodisiac aroma, truffles are sparingly used to enhance
dishes.  The world’s most expensive
truffle was a 2 pound 10 ounce (1191 gram) rare White Alba truffle that sold
for US$112,000.

 

Also at Il Ponte, every Saturday and
Sunday at lunchtime (11:30 a.m. – 2:30 p.m.), your children, the chefs of the
future, are invited to explore their culinary and creative talents by making
their own pizza!  Our Chef will then bake
your child’s masterpiece to simmering perfection!

 

Il Ponte features the finest Italian
cuisine from tempting pasta and wood-fired brick oven pizza to mouthwatering
regional dishes.  Il Ponte also has an extensive
choice of exquisite Italian and international wines.  

 

For reservations or enquiries, please
call Il Ponte at (02) 317-3270.  The prices quoted above are already inclusive of tax
and service charge.
