SPRING TAKE-OUT BOXES 

FOR GOURMET PICNICS IN SEOUL

 

29 March 2016, Seoul, Korea… Spring is on its way,
and as the weather gets warmer, the urge to spend time outdoors grows stronger
and stronger!  The cherry blossoms dot
the sky with their ethereal petals and the birds tickle our ears with their
joyous song.  It’s the perfect backdrop
to picnic outdoors with one of our lunch box sets to go.  Both Cilantro Deli and Genji, the hotel’s
Japanese restaurant, offer gourmet lunch boxes and take-out food items that
will delight your palate as you revel in the beauty of spring.  

 

Cilantro Deli has a variety of sandwiches,
rolls, breads, pastries and cakes – easily wrapped up to go to be enjoyed on
picturesque Namsan mountain or even at your office or home.  Some of the menu items include: Pretzel
Sandwich (KW8,000); Cheese Stick Sandwich (KW8,000); Club Sandwich (KW9,500);
Ham and Cheese Sandwich (KW9,500); Healthy Vegetable Sandwich (KW8,500); Panini
Sandwich (KW10,000); Smoked Salmon Sandwich (KW10,000); and Avocado Salmon Roll
(KW12,000). Cakes and pastries range in price from KW800 to KW12,000.  

 

Take out coffees, juices and other
beverages are also available. Don’t forget to take advantage of the deli’s
Happy Hour special!  From 8:00PM to

10:00PM, they are discounted by 50%.

Park is just steps away. 

 

Genji, the hotel’s Japanese restaurant,
will offer take out bento boxes to be enjoyed anywhere.  Five different lunch sets are available to
