								NANTA is a non-verbal performance derived from the traditional Korean instrumental performance “Samulnori.” The kitchen is its backdrop, chefs its main characters. Knives and other kitchen utensils are transformed into musical instruments in the hands of the performers. They thrill the audience with acrobatic cooking shows, a surprise wedding ceremony, and an exciting dumpling challenge. The coup de grace is a “Three-Drum Dance,” in which a drummer beats three standing kitchenware drums while his cohorts slice through the air around him.Hotel NANTA, newly opened on March, 2017, is the best luxurious hotel in Jeju located on the slopes of Mt. Halla, with 204 rooms. Hotel NANTA offers the best place for family gatherings, luxurious weddings, and grand international conferences.NANTA Academy, managed by PMC Production offers various opportunities such as Drum, Dance-NANTA lesson, and 1-hour NANTA experience program for tourists’ special memories beyond watching NANTA Show.
