EurasTech Corp. Supported by NTB
(National Tech-Bank) and 

and Foundation for International Technology
Network



To Hold the 2nd INNOMED
Biomedical Technology Transfer Seminar on March 18th 

Seoul,
Korea, February 15, 2016 -  As healthcare authorities in the world are
trying to find solutions to deliver the best quality medical services to
population, medical technology developers and equipment makers have prepared various cost-effective ways to overcome
existing issues with the help of high-tech and innovations. 

 

On March
18 Eurastech Corp. supported by NTB (National Tech-Bank) and Foundation for International Technology
Network 

of Korea will hold the
2st INNOMED seminar devoted to emerging trends in biomedical technologies
in Seoul. Organized at newly opened Eurasia Business Center the conference will
attract Russian, CIS, Abkhazia and Korean business representatives, officials
and outstanding scholars to discuss and share innovative technologies in
healthcare industry. 

 

Biomedical technology involves the application of
engineering and technology principles to the domain of living or biological
systems. Usually biomedical denotes a greater stress on problems related
to human health and diseases. Biomedical engineering combined with Biotechnology
is often called Biomedical Technology or Bioengineering. It has two
wings: Biomedical Engineering (dealing more with the Biophysics), and
Biotechnology (dealing more with the Biochemistry).

 

High
population growth, increased life expectancy coupled with high mortality rate and
ageing, prevalence of lifestyle related diseases and aspiration of high quality
healthcare is putting pressure on healthcare providers to be more innovative
and invest in providing high quality care and integrated services and
equipment. Although healthcare challenges can vary from region to region, health
systems of every type around the world have the same objective: to finance and
deliver the highest possible quality of care to the maximum number f people at
the lowest possible cost.

 

Prominent
researchers will introduce their own works at Innomed - Dr. Sergey Gagarsky, specializing on lazer medical
technologies, Dr. Valeev , whose main directions of research
and applied works are vibration, vibration protection, systems with quasi-zero
stiffness, and
a specialist on molecular and medical genetics Ekaterina Zmirko from GeNext &
TestGene Group, Ulianovsk. 

 



Dr. Sergey Gagarsky , PhD, Senior Researcher at  St. Petersburg National Research University of
Information Technologies, Mechanics and Optics (ITMO) will make presentation on
“Lazer medical technologies and systems”. He received his PhD in 1999 from
the Institute, renamed later as «ITMO University», with thesis: "CONTROL
OF RADIATION PARAMETERS OF PULSED SOLID-STATE RAMAN LASERS BASED ON THE
POLYFUNCTIONAL NON-LINEAR MEDIA".  Ekaterina
Zmirko, Manager on Business Development, GeNext & TestGene  Group, Ulianovsk will introduce “Current
Contents of Innovations in Molecular Diagnostics”. Ekaterina Zmirko has more
than 12 years of experience in the field of molecular and medical genetics
(Institute of Genetics and Experimental Biology, Institute of Biochemistry);

 

There is a
problem to protect a human or equipment against high vibration. The goal is to
provide vibration isolation with very high efficiency. This theme will be
covered by Anvar
Valeev, PhD, Assistant Professor, Ufa State Petroleum Technological University
in his “Vibration isolators with quasi-zero 
Stiffness” speech.  Dr. Anvar
Valeev is an Assistant Professor of Department of Oil and Gas  Transportation and Storage at the Ufa State
Petroleum Technological  University (Ufa,
Russian Federation). He is director and founder of MIP Vibroprotection, its
goal is commercialization of scientific developments of the University. Dr.
Valeev received his Ph.D. degree in 2013. Author of 1 monograph, 7 patents and
more than 80 scientific articles (26 articles in  peer-reviewed journal).
