								Fradia is a floating cultural space on the Hangang (River) with excellent riverside views. Fradia is a combination of “freedom” and “diamond,” indicating its vision to become a “valuable place that shines freely.” Equipped with modern acoustic instrument and stage devices, all types of performances are possible. The stage and seats can be freely re-arranged, making the venue great for various events such as music concerts, fashion shows, brand launching parties, and large banquets. It also offers F&B services, with the best group of experts providing quality services for guests.
