Winter packages from
The Ritz-Carlton, Seoul

 

The
Ritz-Carlton, Seoul presents two luxurious winter packages to keep you warm at
the coldest time of the year. Both seasonal packages are available from
November 21 this year to February 29, 2016, with the exception of Christmas Eve
on December 24. 

 

The Stay
Gorgeous package includes one night in a Superior Deluxe Room, two winter
cocktails at The Ritz Bar, currently one of Gangnam's hot local venues thanks
to its popular DJ sessions, and a certificate offering 50% savings on nail
decorating and pedicure treatments. 

Guests
choosing the Stay Gorgeous package will also be offered a special edition pack
of beauty products compiled by British brand Grace Cole and inspired by The
Ritz-Carlton, Seoul. Luxury bathing product maker Grace Cole received a
prestigious Queen's Award for Enterprise this year; this special edition pack
is a selection of its top products, with one bottle of Boutique perfumed
moisturizing cream (250ml), and either a Boutique Travel Miniatures set (3 x
50ml) or a tube of Boutique Hand & Nail Cream (50ml) (pack composition to
be determined at random). The Stay Gorgeous package is priced at 235,000 won
(plus tax and service charge). 

The Stay
Cozy package, ideal for a private winter party, offers one night in a
Balcony Deluxe Room, plus a seasonal menu of Glühwein and finger food. To make
sure you stay warm and cozy, a special Ritz-Carlton-branded blanket and bed
socks are also included. 

Balcony
Deluxe Rooms boast unique views across the city. Bathed in sunshine during the
day and offering romantic vistas of the lights of Seoul by night, they are
ideal for taking a well-earned break with someone special. The Stay Cozy
package is priced at 350,000 won (plus tax and service charge).
