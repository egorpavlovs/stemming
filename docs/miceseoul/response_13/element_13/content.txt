ST. PATRICK’S DAY CELEBRATIONS AT OAK ROOM

 

9 March 2016, Seoul, Korea… A little luck of the Irish
will be coming to the Oak Room, Millennium Seoul Hilton’s traditional English-style bar, on March
18th (Fri.) and 19th (Sat.). Guests will receive a
complimentary welcome drink with no cover charge.  

 

In honor of St. Patrick’s Day, the two day celebration will be complete with its festive décor, green beer, and Irish
ambience. Oak
Room will offer specially-priced Guinness Beer Sets for patrons to choose from.
Guinness set A is priced at KW 40,000 and includes 2 glasses of Guinness beer,
and a fruit set. Set B is priced at KW 80,000 and includes 4 glasses of
Guinness and a fruit set. And set C is priced at KW 120,000 which includes 6
glasses of Guinness and a fruit set. Also, various green cocktails will be
served celebrating St. Patrick’s Day. So, treat your inner Leprechaun to a
weekend of fun.

☞ All prices include a service charge and V.A.T. 

 

St. Patrick’s Day is celebrated on March
17 every year.  Named after the patron
saint of Ireland, this holiday started as a religious holiday, but has since
evolved to be more of a secular celebration of Irish culture that has permeated
the globe.  People wear green, dye their
food and drinks green on this jovial day. 
The Chicago River is dyed green every year, and even the N Tower in
Seoul is illuminated in green lights to celebrate St. Patrick’s Day.  

 

The Oak Room is a traditional
English-style bar with a log fire for cold winter nights, but also features a
patio garden with a breathtaking view to enjoy when the weather is just right
outside!  Offering a wide selection of
international beers and cocktails as well as a tempting menu, the Oak Room is
the perfect place to unwind after work with colleagues or enjoy a casual meal with friends and family. 

 

For
reservations or enquiries, please call the Oak Room at (02) 317-3234.
