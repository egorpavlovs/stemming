								Chul Ki Choi who is president of
Persona Inc directed and produced many non-verbal performances. ‘CHEF’ is one
of the main performances that Persona Inc. produced, it is a performance
exhibiting Choi’s know-how from 10
years’ experience. Although there is no dialogue in ‘CHEF’, the overall story
is told in a natural and fun way because of Choi Chul Ki’s 10-year devotion to
non-verbal performances.

The main story of musical ‘CHEF’ is two chef’s cook-off to prove who’s best.
The cook-off features live beatboxing and stunning b-boying. This fast, exciting, appetizing and out-of-this-world
musical will keep the audience on the edge of the their seat!
