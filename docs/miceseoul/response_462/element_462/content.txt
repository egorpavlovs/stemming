			Introduction
Since January 2017, WALKERHILL HOTEL & RESORT has been newly managed as Walkerhill's own brand, 'WALKERHILL HOTEL & RESORT'. Not only was former Sheraton Grande Walkerhill reborn as Grand Walkerhill Seoul, but Vista Walkerhill Seoul (former W Seoul Walkerhill) was also re-opened in April after the 3-month construction for renewal, based on the concept of 'Sustainable Luxury'. Recently, the Executive Floor 'Grand Club by Walkerhill' is re-opened after the construction for renewal. It is fully equipped with premium rooms and Grand Club Executive Lounge that is best known for its sky view. New amenities and various services of 'Grand Club by Walkerhill' improve guest satisfaction.
