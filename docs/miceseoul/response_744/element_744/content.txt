For this month's promotion, Chef Chan has created a menu of Sichuan dishes best loved by Korean diners, enhanced with his own signature artistic touch to create a visual and gastronomic feast. 
 
Menu highlights include à la carte dishes such as spicy chicken with Sichuan peppercorns, mushrooms and chili peppers pickled in the traditional Sichuan style with salt and water, tantan noodles with traditional Sichuan sauce, Chengdu dishes prepared in the ancient Han Dynasty style, and Korean perennial favorite chicken fried with Sichuan peppercorns. A set-course menu is also available. Chef Chan will serve a selection of Cantonese seafood dishes to accompany his Sichuan fare. Set-course menu prices range from KRW 228,000 to 268,000.

Just 40 tickets, available on a first come first served basis, each include a glass of champagne and tastings of five varieties of Shui Jing Fang baiju, and are priced at KRW 268,000 (including tax and service charge).
