	[InterContinental] Strawberry Collection 2015

Strawberry Dessert Promotions 2015

 



Located in Seoul’s Samseong-dong,
Grand InterContinental Seoul Parnas and InterContinental Seoul COEX will host
their celebrated annual strawberry dessert buffet for a limited time beginning
January 16th. Last year, the strawberry dessert promotion recorded a 50%
increase in attendees compared to the previous year.

 

The first strawberry dessert
buffet was offered in 2007 and sought to expand the variety of strawberry
desserts available. As strawberries are a sensitive fruit that can easily go
bad, maintaining only the freshest strawberries has been a primary goal since the
beginning. In the 7 years since the start of the buffet the availability and
diversity of strawberry desserts has grown and customers have become even more
discerning. Thus the InterContinental has renewed its focus on supplying fresh,
delicious strawberries while also inventing creative new dishes that capitalize
on this favored fruit.

 

The buffet differentiates itself
from other strawberry events with its top-quality ingredients. The strawberries
are cultivated using eco-friendly methods in the South Jeolla Province’s
Damyang County, one of three most famous regions for producing sweet
strawberries. They are grown with the clean water and soil of the remote region
and were the first strawberries in the nation to receive a geographical
indication and be certified under international ISO9001 and ISO14001 standards
for their quality and environment management.

 

The strawberries are even
harvested during the cool dawn to ensure their freshness and specialists
examine color, shape, size and weight to maintain uniformity. These
strawberries are then packaged and transported straight from the farms.

 

Elite Italian Chef Federico Rossi’s “Strawberries in the Sky”

 

While in previous years the
strawberry promotion was held exclusively in the two hotel lobbies, this year
the buffet will also be held in the Sky Lounge Italian Restaurant & Bar,
located on the 30th floor of the InterContinental Seoul COEX. Customers can
enjoy Chef Federico Rossi’s strawberry course menu while taking in spectacular
views of the city.

 

This substantial afternoon buffet
will include appetizers, main dishes and desserts all made with fresh
strawberries, so guests may want to take that into account and expect that they
can pass on lunch or dinner - or maybe even both should they really fill up on
strawberries. 

 

A buffet section boasting a large
selection of dishes made from strawberries such as sandwiches, pasta, couscous,
pizza, tarts and cakes can be enjoyed without limits. Chef Federico Rossi’s two
main dishes, strawberry risotto and grilled salmon topped with strawberry
coulis balsamic sauce, will enhance the savory experience.

 

Sky Lounge’s Strawberry in the Sky
will only be held exclusively on Saturdays and Sundays from 3 to 5 p.m. and the
price per person will be KRW 45,000.

 

For reservations and questions:
Sky Lounge Italian Restaurant & Bar, 30F, (02) 3430-8630 

 

InterContinental Lobby Lounge’s “Strawberry Collection” 

 

The Strawberry Collection, true to
its name, will present a wide variety of desserts, from strawberries dipped in
fondue from a pink chocolate fountain, to strawberry marshmallow and strawberry
flambé prepared live in front of guests by the hotel Patisserie Chef. The
flambé is a traditional French cooking method which uses caramel syrup and
alcohol which is lit on fire to bring out the sweet flavors of the strawberry.
Powdered sugar is sprinkled on top along with some whipped cream completing a
perennial favorite of the strawberry season. There will also be sweet
strawberry pistachio cream cake, strawberry cheesecake and sugary strawberry
compote.

 

An assortment of other desserts
include crispy strawberry pie, moist strawberry pudding, strawberry whipped
cream cake, strawberry custard, French mille-feuille, strawberry macarons,
lemon and strawberry roulade (German roll cake), strawberry cake and
traditional Italian panna cotta - strawberry flavored of course.

 

Price per person is KRW 45,000 for
adults, and KRW 27,000 for children

The Strawberry Collection runs
Friday afternoons from 12 to 3 PM and will have two seatings on Saturdays and
Sundays. Reservations are required.
