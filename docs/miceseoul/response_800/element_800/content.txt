 CHEF PARK: AN ARTISANAL TREASURE 

COOKS UP A FEAST

 

15 September 2014, Seoul, Korea… Seasons, Millennium
Seoul Hilton’s acclaimed French restaurant, is pleased to announce that
Executive Chef Hyo Nam Park has been designated by the Korean government as an
Artisanal Craftsman for his incredible culinary talent.  

 

To commemorate this honor, Seasons will
offer a special Artisanal Menu, crafted by Chef Park.  Available to the public throughout the month
of October, this gastronomic feast will highlight Chef Park’s culinary skills
at their best.  

 

Dishes such as Seared Scallops with Crisp
Potato and Green Leaves in a Truffle Vinaigrette; Steamed Lobster with Spinach
Ravioli in a Crustacean Saffron Cappuccino Sauce; and ‘Hanwoo’ Tenderloin in
Perigounine Sauce served with Green Asparagus and Idaho Potato Puree will be
served.

The exclusive Artisanal Menu is priced at
KW150,000 per person and the menu is subject to change.

 

Chef Park is no doubt a tour de force in
the kitchen who has received prestigious honors and accolades, including the
Order of Agricultural Merit from France, and being inducted as a Lufthansa Star
Chef (along with celebrated chefs Paul Bocuse, Hemant Oberoi, and Susur
Lee).  

 

Chef Park’s signature cooking style laces French
cooking with subtle Korean accents.  His unequalled
originality blends traditional with modern – a manifestation of his commitment
to culinary innovation and perfection.
