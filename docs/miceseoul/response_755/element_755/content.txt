	MILLENNIUM SEOUL HILTON NAMSSANTS –

		 MILLENNIUM SEOUL HILTON NAMSSANTS – 
LAUNCHING ON MAY 28!
 
28 May 2015, Seoul, Korea… In celebration of Director of Culinary Bernd Butz’s new appointment at Millennium Seoul Hilton, the hotel is launching its signature pastry item: Namssants!  Made from a secret recipe developed by Chef Butz himself, who was a celebrated pastry chef before he became an executive chef, Namssants will be made available to the public starting May 28th at Cilantro Deli.
 
Namssants is a portmanteau of Namsan, the mountain on which the hotel stands, the ubiquitous French croissant, and delicious donuts. Much like the beloved cronut (a crossing of the croissant and the donut that was first developed by Chef Dominique Ansel at his New York bakery in 2013), Namssants hope to take the foodie world by storm with a unique and delicious dessert that will represent the beauty and significance of Mt. Namsan to Seoulites. Namssants is priced at KRW 3,000 per piece.
 
Crunchy on the outside, yet soft and delectable on the inside, Namssants are a decadent treat you will instantly fall in love with.  While typical croissants boast about 32 layers of pastry (created by continuously rolling butter into folded dough), Namssants will feature an incredible 288 layers of indulgence for 9 times more tasting pleasure!
 
Cilantro Deli offers a variety of coffees and other beverages for both dine-in and take out.  There is a sumptuous selection of goods such as decadent cakes, handmade chocolates and gourmet fresh baked breads and pastries.  The Deli also offers prepared sandwiches and salads that are perfect for grabbing on the go or to enjoy leisurely in the newly revamped seating section in the lobby.  There is also a wide selection of fine wines and champagnes for sale – ideal for a celebration or as a thoughtful gift. 

 
Don’t forget to take advantage of the deli’s Happy Hour special!  From 8:00PM to 9:00PM, all breads and pastry items are discounted by 30%.  From 9:00PM to 10:00PM, they are discounted by 50%.
 
Cilantro Deli will be open from 6:00AM to 10:00PM, seven days a week. 
 
For enquiries, please call Cilantro Deli at (02) 317-3064.  Prices quoted above are already inclusive of tax and service charge.
