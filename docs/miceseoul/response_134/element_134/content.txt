								MODETOUR International was established in 2008 as a specialized inbound subsidiary of MODETOUR NETWORK, a leading travel wholesaler in Korea. We specialize not only in travel packages and FIT Tours but also MICE-related incentive tours and much more. MODETOUR has also been formally recognized for the quality of its services, having won prizes and being designated as an excellent travel company by national tourism agencies in 2009 and 2010. We also received a Prime Minister’s Citation award and the $2,000 Gold Tower of Tourism promotion award in 2012, as well as ranking No.1 for Chinese inbound tours that same year. Though bringing Chinese visitors to Korea is our specialty, we are also extending our reach to Southeast Asia, Japan, America, Europe, and the Middle East. Whatever your requirements in Korea, MODETOUR guarantees win-win policies with local service companies such as transport, hotels, restaurants, tourist spots, and more.
