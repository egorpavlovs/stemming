Meeting Rooms
One of Coex’s great strengths lies in the abundance and flexibility of its meeting rooms. Coex’s 55 rooms can be divided into over 90 different spaces to accommodate meetings of any size.

North Wing

	① Grand Ballroom
	The Grand Ballroom is a 1,817m² pillar-free space that can be divided into five sections. It is ideal for conference breakout sessions and combined conference/exhibition events.
	② Conference Room North
	Remodeled in 2018, Conference Room North features asymmetrical meetings rooms on both sides of rooms 201–203 (ASEM Ballroom) in the center. Rooms 201–203 holds a combined theater-style seating capacity for over 900 and has been renamed as the ASEM Ballroom in commemoration of the 3rd ASEM Summit which was hosted here in 2000. The facilities are well-suited for large-scale events, especially when used in accompaniment with the Grand Ballroom on the first floor. The eight small to medium-sized meeting rooms flanking rooms 201-203 can be used not only for seminars and conferences but also as executive offices and waiting rooms.
	③ Auditorium
	The sweeping 1,080-seat Auditorium is furnished with a superb acoustics and a built-in translation system, making it ideal for international conferences. The 998m² lobby’s glass wall faces the historic Bongeunsa Temple across the street.


South Wing

	④ Conference Room E
	Hall E is a 1,559m² multipurpose space that divides into 8 sections. The modern, carpeted hall can host exhibitions, conferences, or banquets.
	⑤ Conference Room South 3F
	Specifically designed for smaller meetings and seminars, Conference Room South on the third floor offers a lot of flexibility. In total, there are 29 rooms that can be divided into 50 smaller rooms. Five larger rooms(seating capacity of 300) and 23 medium and small-sized rooms allow for various combinations within close proximity to each other. Conference Room South is located adjacent to Coex’s specialized exhibition halls, Hall A and Hall C. It is therefore an ideal place to hold exhibition- related seminars. The 207 m² conference spaces come equipped with translation booths while the smaller 54 m² rooms all have fully automated screens.
       ⑥ Conference Room South 4F
      Located on the fourth floor of Coex, Conference Room South(Room 401) is a theater-style conference room that seats 441. Two adjacent mid to large sized conference rooms are perfect for other related banquets, seminars, or workshops. Tiered seating in Room 401 allows for excellent visibility and audience participation in a more intimate arrangement. Conference Room South on the fourth floor is often used for anniversaries and annual events connected to government agencies, associations, and other groups. Fixed screens, lightings, and high-end A/V systems facilitate the production of any necessary effects for musicals or other live performances. Wood veneer gives all three rooms a warm, relaxed atmosphere. The lobby draws in natural sunlight, making it the ideal place for coffee breaks, receptions, or registration areas.



Exhibition Halls
Coex’s four exhibition halls are the most popular venues for trade shows in Korea. Each hall connects directly to spacious loading docks, and is equipped with expansive utility trenches. Halls A and B on the first floor connect via swing space, as do halls C and D on the third floor.

	③ Hall C
	Hall C is a 10,348m² space with a large pillar-free middle section. Hall C can be partitioned, giving it an edge in attracting specialized exhibitions and large-scale meetings.
