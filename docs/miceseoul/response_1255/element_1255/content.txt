		Seoul Hot Summer Sale - This August Meet in Style, Then Shop in Style
		2013-08-01
		
			
			
Business visitors to Seoul throughout the coming month will have even more incentive to explore their event’s host city thanks to the month-long Seoul Hot Summer Sale 2013 with participating businesses across the city offering benefits from discounts on their products and services to free gifts. The event is open exclusively to international visitors.
During the month-long sale, attendees can easily fill up their time between meetings by exploring the many bargains to be had at affiliated Seoul Hot Summer Sale department stores, duty free shops, shopping malls, large supermarkets, cosmetics and clothing vendors, cultural facilities, banks, restaurants, souvenir shops and more. The majority of these will be located in the city’s most popular tourist areas, including Myeongdong, Dongdaemun, and Gangnam – all well-known for their many boutique shops and cosmetic stores. Gangnam in particular has been a major focus of the promotion, with the world-famous district now Seoul’s most popular tourist destination, as well as being home to many of the city’s premier convention centers and hotels.
Additionally, there will be special online events at the sale’s official website, www.seoulsale.com (m.seoulsale.com for mobiles) where participants who fill out satisfaction surveys and/or photograph themselves beside posters advertising the event will be eligible for prizes. Hallyu (Korean Wave) fans will have no trouble identifying the posters, which will feature Korean pop celebrities 2PM – the Honorary Ambassadors for the Seoul Hot Summer Sale.
A total of 60,000 welcome brochures containing discount cards and information on participating businesses will be issued throughout August. The brochures will be available at the Seoul Tourism Organization information booth at Incheon International Airport, the Seoul Global Culture & Tourism Center, and the brand-new Gangnam Tourist Information Center, along with various tourism centers across the city. A full list of tourism centers can be seen at the Visit Seoul website (www.visitseoul.net).
STO will also be adding more locations for the brochures soon – stay tuned to the official event page at www.seoulsale.com for updates and additional information.
Visitors will see their first promotion of the sale on digital displays at Incheon Airport. This service is also available to meeting planners hosting an event in Seoul and is just one of the many complimentary services offered by the Seoul Convention Bureau to help promote conventions and exhibitions. Visit www.miceseoul.com or email mice@seoulwelcome.com to find out more.
The Seoul Hot Summer Sale is an annual tourism marketing event hosted by the Seoul Metropolitan Government and organized by the Seoul Tourism Organization.
