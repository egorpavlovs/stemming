		Seoul Secures Bid for 36th Symposium on Combustion
		2012-08-16
		
			
			More Associations Winning Bids with Seoul Convention Bureau Support
Seoul was announced host of the 36th biennial congress of the Combustion Institute during the 34th Symposium on Combustion in Warsaw on August 3.  The 2016 symposium will be held in Seoul’s Coex convention center, and is expected to bring over 700 international experts from 70 countries, along with over 500 participants from Korea.  The secured bid is another in a series of wins for Korean associations that have benefitted from Seoul Convention Bureau (SCB) support for their bidding process.
Insuk Jung, chairman of bidding for the Korean Society of Combustion, worked closely with the SCB in preparation for the bid. The SCB provided financial support, letters of support from the mayor of Seoul and the CEO of Seoul Tourism Organization, and also counseling on bid proposals and presentations.  As a result, the bid by the Korean Society of Combustion received an overwhelmingly positive response by the chairmen of the Combustion Institute during its recent symposium in Warsaw.
Seoul’s rise to fifth in the world for the hosting of international congresses is in part due to the increased activity of its local science and health industry associations.  After a recent SCB-sponsored site inspection of Seoul for the Executive Committee of CHI 2015 (computer-human interaction), the conference organizers remarked that the strength of the local CHI professionals was a significant draw,
“We were compelled by the size of the CHI community in Korea, the ongoing involvement of that community in the CHI Conference, and the significant presence in Korea of companies who are involved in the user experience.  Taken together there was a strong feeling that Seoul would be the best destination for our first Asian CHI conference.”
Along with strong local association chapters and a rapidly growing meetings industry, bidding support by the SCB and the Seoul Metropolitan Government has led to over 100 bid wins for events in Seoul to be held from 2012-2018.  The hosting of these events is expected to bring in over 1.3 trillion won (1.15 billion USD) in revenue for the city.
Upcoming events in Seoul include the 2014 International Congress of Mathematicians, the 26th International Society of Hypertension Biennial Scientific Meeting 2016, and the General Session of the International Association for Dental Research in 2016.
