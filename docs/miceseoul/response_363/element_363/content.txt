								Being called the Jacobean style, the design of Aston House is based on the British royal mansion built in the 17th century, which has been widely known for its richness in color and detail, and dignity of a classical design. Aston House is the special venue for a banquet representing an exotic atmosphere and the Korean beauty. In particular, it is named after Aston Hall that was a famous seventeenth century royal mansion erected in the reign of the dynasty of the House of Stuart. As the epitome of the Jacobean style, Aston Hall has a significant historical value, and represents splendor and luxury. Having named after Aston Hall, Aston House is characterized by the balance of a classic style and simple design, thereby creating a restful atmosphere like home. After the 3-month renovation work from January to March 2017, it follows luxury and comfort as well as a trendy style and modernity with the concept of ‘Modern Luxury’.
