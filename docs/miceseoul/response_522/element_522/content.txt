        The National Folk Museum of Korea is a public cultural institute dedicated to
research, exhibition, education, and preservation of the culture of everyday life
of the Korean people. The museum has three permanent exhibition galleries
devoted to traditional culture and folklore in Korea, two special exhibition
galleries that present temporary special exhibitions about folklore of countries
from all over the world, and an exhibition space dedicated to the collection of
donated artifacts. Other facilities include an outdoor exhibition space where
scenes of everyday life of the Korean people from different periods of history are
shown- from a traditional Korean village to streets of modern times and recent
years- and the Children’s Museum dedicated to inspiring children through handson
activities.
