								Guidebook builds beautiful mobile apps for meetings and events of all sizes, putting everything at the attendees’ fingertips via their smartphones and tablets. Our apps also unlock new sponsorship opportunities and allow organizers to collect feedback in real-time. Guidebook's mobile apps are optimized for all platforms (iOS, Android, BlackBerry, Windows, etc.) and also works offline, which is critical in most crowded event venues. We offer a host of features designed to engage attendees, including a news feed, one-to-one messaging, interactive maps, personalized schedules, shared photo galleries, social media, sponsor & exhibitor profiles and a whole lot more! Whether you’re planning for one event or one hundred, Guidebook offers a cost-effective way to communicate and engage with your audience via mobile.
