								Planned by Seoul Metropolitan Government in 2006, Dongdaemun Design Plaza (DDP) opened its door on 21st March 2014. DDP is running 24 hours a day and functioning as an open space for public. The purpose of DDP is to use design-thinking for innovation and development. Also, DDP is introducing world design trends and design innovations as a birthplace of 21st century creative knowledge. DDP designed by Iraqi-British Architect Zaha hadid has a concept to aim to fuse all conflicting elements into a harmony. As design is the power to create the future, the design of DDP is aimed to create a socio-hub, recreating the dynamism of Korea. DDP is a building with 4 stories above and 3 stories under the ground. It has 5 spaces with 15 facilities such as Design Museum, Art Hall, Business Centre, Park, and Convenient Facilities. There are some remarkable features in DDP. In particular, the 45,133 curved aluminum panels covering the building are identically designed which is an orchestration of the most superior technical capabilities. DDP aims to revitalize the local economy and pursue mutual growth by encouraging public engagement and business. Dongdaemun has historically been a place for not only cultural experience but also business. The aim of DDP is focused on revitalizing Seoul’s creative industries and building a global network. Also, we are focusing on adding futuristic content to cultural assets. In doing so, DDP will be functioning as a center of culture and creativity that can allow visitors to see Korea’s dynamism and Asia’s creativity in the future.
