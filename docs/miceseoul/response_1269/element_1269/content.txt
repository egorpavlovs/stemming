		Sung-Real Lee appointed CEO of Seoul Tourism Organization
		2012-07-17
		
			
			Seoul Tourism Organization named Sung-Real Lee the CEO and  President on July 2nd. Under the new leadership,  STO looks to boost its profile as a tourism destination and increase its  competitiveness in the international meetings industry.
One of CEO Lee’s key tasks will be to help expand the  accommodation infrastructure in Seoul, “As the city is set to host a  record number of 10 million international visitors this year, it is  essential for Seoul to continue expanding the number of hotel rooms in  the city – especially those that are specifically geared towards  accommodating international visitors,” said STO’s CEO Sung-Real  Lee.
At his opening speech for the 3rd annual  Seoul MICE Forum, Lee also stressed the importance of furthering  Seoul’s meetings industry, “the meetings industry is a key service  industry that will lead the way in the knowledge-oriented economy of the  future. Seoul and Korea are not alone in this belief - all major cities  and countries of the world are currently engaged in an intense battle  to increase their competitiveness by investing in the meetings  industry.”
Lee enters STO after over 30 years in the private sector,  during which he served as the head of key finance and project  development divisions in the Hyundai Group.
