        From the driveway to a people’s wayThe Seoul Station Overpass, which was built in 1970, was exposed to safety problems and about to be demolished, but it was revived into 17 pedestrian pathways that act as a gateway in Seoul and catalyst for regional regeneration, also known as the urban regeneration project Seoullo 7017. It offers a living display of greenery and plants, as well as a 1km long panoramic view in the center of Seoul that combines the functions of a public aerial walkway linking six areas and the green square.TransportationFrom Incheon Int’l Airport: 40MinutesSubway Station: 5minutes walk from exit number 7 of subway line 1 seoul StationNearby Hotels and AttractionsWithin 3km: ManuHotel, Kpop Hotel, Millennium Seoul Hilton HotelWithin 5km: fourpointsseoulnamsan Hotel, New Oriental Hotel,Streets: Myeong-dong streetShopping: Namdaemun market, shinsegye department storeHistorical and cultural sites: Sungnyemun gate, Old seoul station, namsan parkFACILITIESName of HallLocationSize(㎡)StandingSeatedMalli-dong SquareOutside1F10,3501,000500Major Events2017 May, Seoullo 7017 Grand Opening CeremonySpecial FeaturesHallyu culture spot where history and nature coexistPerformances, exhibitions, experiences, meals all possible in one place
