		Seoul Tourism Organization Opens Online MICE Help Desk and Hotline (STO Press Release)
		2015-07-10
		
			
			Seoul, South Korea, July 8, 2015 – The Seoul Tourism Organization (STO) has launched a new online MICE help desk and hotline service for MICE organizers as Seoul finishes curbing the MERS outbreak. The new services will be in effect from July 10 until the end of August. The services are intended to facilitate quicker responses to the queries of individuals and organizations who are scheduled to host a MICE event in Seoul or have questions about the MICE support services Seoul offers.
The Seoul online MICE Help Desk is a new message board system that can be accessed through the Seoul MICE homepage (http://www.miceseoul.com). Those with MICE-related questions can write on the message board or send an email to the Help Desk. The Help Desk will then forward the question to the best appropriate person so that a prompt and thorough response can be made within 24 hours. More pressing questions can also be made via the MICE phone hotline, a 24 hour phone line intended for drastic MICE emergencies.
