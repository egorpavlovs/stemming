ENJOY THE AUTUMN STROLL WITH  A
CUP OF TEA  

ALONG THE SOWOL-RO AT MILLENNIUM SEOUL HILTON!



 

19 October 2015, Seoul, Korea… Millennium Seoul Hilton’s delicatessen,
Cilantro Deli is offering gourmet selections that you can take with you. Just
in time for autumn, these packed lunches are ideal for dining in the al fresco
beauty among the autumn breeze, or in the comfort of your own home or
office.  

 

As the
weather gets cooler and the tree leaves start to turn in brilliant red and
yellow, Seoulites are starting to enjoy their autumn foliage. What better
way to celebrate this season with an outdoor picnic with a warm cup of tea? You
can enjoy Darjeeling, Earl Grey, Peppermint, Chamomile tea or English Breakfast
Tea as a take out for KW 5,000 at the Cilantro Deli. Or choose from an array of
sandwiches (including Club, Vegetable, Ham and Cheese, Panini, Champagne,
Hanoi), four different salads (including Caesar and Caprese), breads and
individual serving-sized desserts at the Cilantro Deli. Sandwiches range
in price from KW8,000 to KW12,000, while salads range from KW9,000 to
KW20,000. Don’t forget to pick up some cake (KW1,200-KW12,000) or handmade
chocolates for a sweet dessert!

 

For
reservations or enquiries, please call Cilantro Deli at (02) 317-3064.
