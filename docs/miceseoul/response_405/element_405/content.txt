Jingwansa
Temple, a 1,000-year-old Buddhist temple located in Jingwan-dong, Eunpyeong-gu,
is easy to access, yet presents a scenery of deep mountain valleys. As it
preserves many tangible and intangible cultural assets, the temple allows
visitors to experience a living history and enjoy the relaxing energy that
lives up to the reputation of this prestigious temple and the dignity felt only
in the temples where many Buddhist masters practiced the way to enlightment.
The food made by the chief monk, a master of Buddhist cuisine, is not only
extremely tasteful, but embodies the symbolic meanings of food for Buddhist zen
practices. It will satisfy foreign visitors who are interested in Buddhist
cuisine.
From the Iljumun Gate (the One Pillar Gate), which is the entrance to the
temple, to the main buildings, visitors may find a series of magnificent
sceneries of nature that change every season. Monks welcome visitors and guide
them around the temple in English. Tea time is also offered with the
opportunity to share a conversation with the monks.
