		Beyond Tourism Benefits Global Research Underway
		2012-05-30
		
			
			Members of the Future Convention Cities Initiative (FCCI) are pushing ahead with the global Beyond Tourism Benefits research, with surveys being distributed in Toronto and soon Durban, and London, Seoul and San Francisco actively securing participants. At a press conference during IMEX Frankfurt, FCCI members emphasized the way in which others can utilize the results of FCCI research and made a call to action for other meetings professionals to engage.
FCCI Chairman, Lyn Lewis-Smith (CEO of Business Events Sydney) said, “This global research is essential for us as an industry to comprehensively understand the legacies of business events, and how these may differ across borders.”
“Sydney has completed two phases of research – the first qualitative, the second quantitative. Now we are progressing the global phase of the quantitative study. I know that the FCCI members are keen to see their city’s results.”
FCCI has commissioned The University of Technology, Sydney (UTS) to conduct the global Beyond Tourism Benefits: Measuring the social legacy of business events.  2012 sees five member cities – London, Toronto, Seoul, San Francisco and Durban – roll out the study in their destinations. Toronto has begun to distribute its surveys and UTS will soon be collating and analyzing the results. And Durban is about to send out its surveys to selected participants.
Next off the rank will be London, Seoul and San Francisco. Abu Dhabi has already completed similar research and these results will contribute to the FCCI study.
Deborah Edwards, Senior Research Fellow in Urban Tourism Leisure, Sport and Tourism at UTS, says “We have met with the FCCI members to explain the study and we have updated the Sydney survey to meet the needs of each city. Together we are working our way towards what we hope will be exciting results. This is a great opportunity to explore global trends and the legacy impact of business events.”
FCCI is a group of member cities that collaborates to shape and accelerate the strategic development of their business events industries. All members could be described as the 'new generation' of convention leaders: they aim to use the latest technology, innovation and research to increase the economic benefits of business events for their cities, and the industry as a whole.
