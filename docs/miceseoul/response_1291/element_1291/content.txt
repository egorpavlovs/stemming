			Seoul Donhwamun Traditional TheaterSeoul Donhwamun Traditional Theater is one of the nation's topnotch performance stages specializing in acoustic traditional music. The theater is located between Changdeokgung Palace- the only palace in the nation listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site- and Jongmyo- a royal Confucian shrine. The Seoul Metropolitan Government purchased the theater’s grounds with the purpose of recovering the identity of the historic area around Changdeonkgung Palace and constructed the Soeul Donhwamun Traditional Theater to promote traditional music. Combining traditional Korean and modern architectural styles, Seoul Donhwamun traditional Theater consists of a theater, the Gugak Madang(Courtyard), cafeteria, studio and other rooms to showcase a variety of traditional music, Korean tradition, and culture. The theater is operated by the Sejong Center for the Performing Arts- Korea's representative cultural and arts institution- and is committed to contributing quality contents and enhancing opportunities for citizens to enjoy the culture and arts.  address   Yulgok-ro, Jongno-gu, Seoul 03134 Koreatel           +82-2-3210-7008fax          +82-2-3210-7020web         www.sdtt.or.kr TransportationSubway  Ten minutes on foot to Changdeokgung Palace from             Jongno3(sam)-ga Station(Line No.1,3,5 Exit 7), five minutes             on foot to Changdeokgung Palace from Anguk Station (Line No. 3, Exit 4)Bus        Use bus numbers below and get off at Changdeokgung Palace bus stop              Numbers 109, 151, 162, 171, 172, 272, 601, 7025, 6011, Seoul city tour bus   DatePerformance TitlePerformance Group7.11.(Tue)—7.14.(Fri)2 p.mSpirit LaundrySeoul MetropolitanTraditional MusicOrchestra7.18.(Tue)—7.21.(Fri)2 p.mNap Contestwith Space Fantasy Coreyah 7.25.(Tue)—7.28.(Fri)2 p.mHimalaya(Nun-ui Geocheo)Seoul MetropolitanYouth TraditionalMusic Orchestra8.1.(Tue)—8.4 (Fri)2 p.mCrunching and Crispyin the Dream Souljigi8.8.(Tue)—8.11 (Fri)2 p.mThe Country of thePoetsThe CulturalPlayground,Fairy Tale Ticket priceKRW 10,000 for all seatsAge5 years or olderReservationWebpage of Seoul Donhwamun TraditionalTheater & Interpark TicketInquiry for reservation82-1544-1555Inquiry for performance82-2-3210-7001~2Hanbok EventOn the performance days of Nap Concert, people,who dress up in hanbok, will receive a 90%discount for the ticket at KRW 1,000.Seoul Summer SaleForeigners, who have their passports with them,will receive a 20% discount for the ticket.
