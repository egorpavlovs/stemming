			Introduction
Tourism is a key industry that determines national wealth in the 21 century. Particularly, the hotel industry, considered to represent the tourism industry, makes huge contributions to the national economy by improving the national image and earning foreign currency with quality services. With this sense of responsibility, Royal Hotel Seoul started on March 12, 1971, as a Deluxe Tour Hotel, based on the private capital only for the first time in Korea's tourism history.For the past half century, we have contributed to the development of Korea's tourism industry and local communities, satisfying both domestic and foreign tourists. Its location in Myeongdong at the Center of Seoul earned Royal Hotel Seoul the nickname of 'OASIS in downtown' from the very beginning. Now it is placed as the best resting place among Seoul citizens and domestic and foreign tourists.In the 21st century, Royal Hotel Seoul is putting one step forward with new visions and philosophy to become one of the best hotels by creating and developing desirable hotel culture, and contributing to the country and local communities.
