Sweet additions to Cilantro Deli 

at Millennium Seoul Hilton

 

6 April 2016, Seoul, Korea… Millennium
Seoul Hilton’s Delicatessen Cilantro Deli showcases 3
new sweet temptations
this spring. Namrocks, Namclairs and Cherry Rings have been created by
Millennium Seoul Hilton’s Director of Culinary, Mr. Bernd Butz to appeal to
lovers of fine pastries.

 

Cherry Rings (KW 6,000) are filled with fresh
dark cherries in liqueur and fresh cream in a round and soft choux topped with cherry
toppings, while Namclairs (KW 7,000) are filled with four different flavours of
mango, strawberry, vanilla, green tea cream topped with colourful chocolate
coated choux. Namclaris are Millennium Seoul Hilton’s version of a well known
dessert called Éclair.

 

In addition to the collection are Namstones
(KW 6,000). With ginseng, mandarin juice and coconut powder coated with dark or
white chocolate are sure to surprise you taste buds.

 

Take out coffees, juices and other
beverages are also available. Don’t forget to take advantage of the deli’s
Happy Hour special!  From 8:00PM to
9:00PM, all breads and pastry items are discounted by 30%. From 9:00PM to
