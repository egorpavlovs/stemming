When
preparing for a trip, luggage tends to be a primary concern for travelers. 
No one wants to drag heavy bags around when they could be using that time to
have fun while sightseeing and shopping.
SAFEX is a convenient and reliable luggage delivery service that will transport
luggage to and from the airport to Seoul.
With SAFEX, travelers can start and finish their travels with peace of mind.

How to use SAFEX
ㆍBook on-site at a SAFEX branch, or online (www.safex.kr). SAFEX’s
service is offered in five languages: Korean, English, simplified Chinese,
traditional Chinese, and Japanese.
ㆍCheck luggage with SAFEX at Incheon Airport, Seoul
Station, or Hongik University Station.
ㆍCheck-in (on-site reservations & pick-up times):
Check luggage with SAFEX at Incheon Airport by 3 p.m. → Pick up luggage at the
hotel’s reception after 7 p.m. on the day of check-in. When departing, check
luggage by 9 a.m. at the hotel’s reception desk → Pick up luggage at Incheon
Airport after 2 p.m. on the day of check-in
ㆍNote: Users should provide their real names and make
sure to enter their hotel name correctly when booking SAFEX online. To ensure a
smooth experience, users should register their real names as their SAFEX user
name. Real name registration allows for a smooth luggage claim process without
having to go through additional verification.
