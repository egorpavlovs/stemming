A NEW LOOK INSIDE MILLENNIUM SEOUL HILTON
 
4 August 2015, Seoul, Korea… Millennium Seoul Hilton, located at the foot of Mt.Namsan in downtown Seoul, announces the completion of a large-scale renovation project that enhanced its deluxe rooms with modern décor and upgraded amenities. 
 
The new generation of guest rooms feature a sophisticated design with refined, modernized lines and simplified décor that appeal to distinguished business guests and upscale travelers alike. Natural, organic designs and material are utilized to bring the calm and serenity of nature indoors.  Blending technology with aesthetics, the large LED TV disappears into the dark wood walls and the eco-friendly LED lighting illuminates the room seamlessly without interrupting the elegantly minimalist features.  The fluidity of the abstract carpeting brings balance to a room that facilitates both work and relaxation for modern guests who enjoy the finer things in life.     , 
 
Millennium Seoul Hilton’s newly remodeled guest rooms feature:
 
   Complimentary Wi-Fi and Hi-Speed Internet Access
   Herman Miller ergonomic chairs and more spacious workspaces
   Eco-friendly LED lighting 
   42-inch LED televisions 
   Newly embellished bathrooms with convenient bidets 
   Larger and more secure in-room safes
   Upgraded minibar
   Improved bedside reading lights
 
Travelers to Seoul can now stay in the freshly renovated guest rooms at Millennium Seoul Hilton. Offering on-site breakfast dining as well as award winning restaurants and a bar, a fitness center, indoor heated pool, and more, this centrally-located Seoul hotel sets the standard for sophisticated tourists and business travelers to Korea.
