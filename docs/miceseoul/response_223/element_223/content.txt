area of 105,000㎡ divided into annexes that
include 252 guest rooms, an art hall, large banquet hall and convention center. The hotel is renowned as a destination
for international events, large/medium/small meetings and wedding ceremonies.A place for healing in the middle of the
city, The-K Hotel Seoul sits within lush natural surroundings including Yangjae
