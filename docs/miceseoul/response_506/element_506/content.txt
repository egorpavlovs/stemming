        Korea House is a cultural multi-complex designed to showcase Korea’s distinctive 
culture to local and international visitors through a range of participatory 
and performance-based programs. The center’s various activities can also be 
used to enhance business events and other activities held onsite.
The venue offers Royal Korean Cuisine formerly enjoyed by the rulers of the 
Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910). Catering can be adjusted to suit a range of dining 
events centered around this rich, eclectic fare. The Korea House performance 
team has been impressing audiences in over 16,000 shows and for a total of 33 
years. Their shows have been enjoyed by more than 1.6 million visitors. Korea 
House also offers experience programs for Korean cooking, the martial art taekgyeon, 
or samulnori, a time-honored Korean style of percussion.
