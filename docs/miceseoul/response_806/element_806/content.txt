	The Sparkling Gallery Package

	Writer : Novotel Ambassador Gangnam		 / Date : 2014/7/28 11:22 / Modified Date 2014/8/12 11:09	

	

						
												
		

In
collaboration with Seoul Arts Center, Novotel Ambassador Gangnam presents the
Sparkling Gallery Package to give you some summer healing time.

 

Novotel Ambassador Gangnam’s Sparkling Gallery Package
includes access to our swimming pool, which has been converted into an outdoor
pool, and two tickets to “the great artists - Renoir to Demian Hirst”
exhibition being held at Seoul Arts Center. The package will be offered from
exclusively until on Aug. 

 

Novotel Ambassador Gangnam’s swimming pool, located in
the “Inbalance Wellness” fitness club on the 3rd floor of the hotel, is
regularly an indoor facility but amazingly transforms into a outdoor facility
for the summer season. The elliptical-shaped ceiling’s dome, which lets guests
admire outdoor views of the sky, will open on beautiful days, transforming it
into an outdoor facility letting in natural light and warm summer air. Spend a
glorious time at the pool without worrying about unexpected rainfalls hampering
the relaxation as the pool’s dome ceiling can be closed for just such an
emergency. After some exercise, guests can also relax and enjoy the massaging
jets at the Jacuzzi located at the outdoor terrace. 

 

Besides complimentary access to the outdoor swimming
pool and Jacuzzi, the Sparkling Gallery Package includes one night in a
comfortable Standard Room, two tickets to “the great artists - Renoir to Demian
Hirst” exhibition, and two bottles of sparkling San Pellegrino Mineral Water
from Italy. For an additional KRW50,000, guests can upgrade to a Superior Room
and enjoy breakfast for two at the hotel’s buffet restaurant, The Square. The
package is priced starting at KRW149,000. *A 10% tax and surcharge will be
added to the aforementioned price.
