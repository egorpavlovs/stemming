								SamulNori is the name of a group of four dynamic
musicians dedicated to performing and preserving traditional Korean music and
dance. The name also refers to the style of music they created. Since these
superb percussionists formed the group in 1978, SamulNori has sparked a
renaissance in Korea’s music scene and garnered worldwide acclaim more than 40
years.The Korean words ‘Samul’ means ‘four things’ and ‘nori’
means ‘to play.’ In the case of SamulNori, it refers to the four musicians
playing and dancing with four percussion instruments. Founded by Kim, Duk-Soo,
the group’s leader and master of the Jang-go(hourglass shape drum), SamulNori
has become the leading traditional Korean Performance group. The ensemble
performs in many configurations but usually tours as a quartet with Master Kim
at the helm. The origins of their music can be traced to what is usually
referred to as farmers’ band music(Poongmul) and ceremonial music(Gut). It also
incorporates the influences of folk and religious music and their intricate
rhythms have become quite uniquely their own.Title : SAMULNORITime : Every THU 7:00pm, FRI 7:00pm, SAT 2:00pm / 5:00pm
