		2012 Seoul Lantern Festival to Shine a Light on City’s Roots
		2012-11-01
		
			
			The 4th annual Seoul Lantern Festival returns to Cheonggyecheon Stream, and will be held from November 2-18. One of the capital’s flagship events, the Seoul Lantern Festival is a visual feast of 30 thousand lanterns hand-crafted by local and international artisans.  This year, the Korean lanterns are in the theme of "Seoul's Roots, the Lifestyles of Our Ancestors" – and will highlight Seoul's 600 year-old history and its many traditions.
Visitors will be able to gaze upon and stroll past lanterns on display from Cheonggye Plaza all the way to Seun Bridge – a walk that spans a total of 1.5 kilometers.  After the official kick-off ceremony on Friday November 2nd, the lanterns will be lit every evening from 5PM to 11PM.  This year around 3 million visitors are expected to enjoy the festival over its 17 day duration.
The lanterns will be split into four different themes: Map of the Capital City, The story of Korean ancestors who shaped the 600 year history of Hanyang (the original name for Seoul) as Joseon’s capital, The daily lives of the people, and Open Seoul. As the City of Seoul hopes to register the ancient fortress walls of Seoul as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, much attention has been put on the Hanyang Capital City lantern, and it will likely be a highlight of the festival.
Similar to last year, this year’s event will feature several hands-on experience programs, including the making of ‘wish lanterns’ and lanterns to welcome 2013, the Year of the Snake.
