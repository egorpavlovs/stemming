First-of-its-kind for Seoul, focused on the arts, music and culture of
vibrant Hongdae

Seoul - RYSE, Autograph Collection is poised to add a new dimension to the dynamic
neighborhood of Hongdae in Seoul, Korea. The hotel features 274 inspiring guest
rooms, including Artist Suites by Laurent Segretier, Charles Munka, Yeojoo
Park, and Maekan. The Executive Producer Suite, located on the twentieth floor,
is a one of a kind space featuring handpicked art works and a graphic wall by
Na Kim. RYSE will also showcase outstanding F&B concepts to connect curious
outsiders and the cool kids of Hongdae.

The bold black exterior was designed by architectural firm SCAAA from Los
Angeles to be a monumental new landmark in Hongdae. Responding to the Hongdae
art, music and nightlife culture, the playful colors on the ground level
encourage pedestrians and curious visitors to use the location as a meeting and
hangout spot. The space is highlighted by a giant, steel sculpture by Kyunghwan
Kwon that pierces through to the fourth floor. The fine balance of the raw
concrete walls, minimal lines and saturated colors can be seen throughout the
hotel and the rooms as designed by Michaelis Boyd from London.

RYSE is home to some of the most exciting hotel collaborations in Asia,
including Korean brands like Worksout retail, IISE fashion and Le Chamber
cocktails. The signature restaurant is Long Chim, led by chef David Thompson of
Michelin-starred Nahm. His high-end street food concept is making its Korean
debut at RYSE with their most ambitious execution to date. Long Chim farms and
mixes their own curry paste blended with coconuts shucked on-premise to deliver
incredibly authentic flavors. The ground floor will be filled with delicious
smells of sourdough bread and roasted coffee by Tartine Bakery from San
Francisco. Side Note Club is the prime vantage point of the fifteenth floor
rooftop with fantastic views and a world-class bartending team from Le Chamber.
