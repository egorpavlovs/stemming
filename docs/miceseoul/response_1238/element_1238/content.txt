								Currently comprised of 95 member-companies, including independent exhibition organizers, trade associations, and exhibitions, the Korea Exhibition Organizers Association aims to promote Korea overseas as a prime destination and marketplace for exhibitions and related trade shows. As part of these efforts, the association cooperates with relevant international organizations in order to ensure global standards and practices among its members. It regularly communicates with government and trade associations on ways to improve national branding for exhibitions, as well as work with government agencies to develop new policies on exhibition practices and marketing. The association also conducts various international marketing activities for Korean exhibitions, organizers and members, who regularly meet to exchange news and information. The Korea Exhibition Industry Expo (http://www.expoexpo.or.kr/) is the association’s key annual trade show designed to introduce local and international buyers to member services and Korean exhibitions overall.
