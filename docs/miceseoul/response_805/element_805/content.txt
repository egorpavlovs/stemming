Festival’

 

Grand
Ambassador Seoul’s premium live buffet ‘THE KING’S’ presents the ‘South
American Food Festival’ available until August 31st. This promotion features traditional cuisine
from not only well known South American countries such as Brazil and Argentina,
but also from more difficult to access countries such as Chile, Ecuador, and
Uruguay among others. The menu has everything from salads and barbecue to
dessert and includes approximately 60 different dishes. Featured recipes
include traditional Brazilian feijoada, churrasco kebabs, Mexican pork back rib
BBQ parrilla, Argentinian fried meat pie empanadas, traditional Peruvian
ceviche, Chilean roasted sea bass with tomatillo sauce, Paraguayan orange custard,
and Bolivian milk spread. 

 

Meanwhile,
ladies who dine at THE KING’S every Monday and Tuesday for the weekday lunch
buffet can enjoy their meal at a 30% discount for a price of KRW46,900
(including surcharges). 

 

Moreover,
there are six special guest rooms that offer 8 to 40 seats and are ideal venues
for hosting special gatherings and regular meetings in a comfortable
environment with high-class service.
