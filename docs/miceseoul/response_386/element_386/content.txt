								As interest in food culture is increasing among customers, ‘The Skyfarm’ has planned this new brand to spread the lifestyle that focuses on fundamental materials, agriculture, food and coexistence with farmers. Farm-to-Table Diningplex, The Skyfarm consists of four places: a dining brand 'The Storage', 'Someone’s Storage', 'All day Fresh Kitchen (Semoa)’ and ‘The Promenade’ that can hold various parties and wedding, capable of personalized banquet space at 50th floor located in The Federation of Korean Industries Building.‘Sadaebu Koggan' is trying to continue the spirit of Ban-ga (noble family of Chosun Dynasty), treating the guest with the most valuables. The Korean Dining, ‘The Storage' serves ‘Bansang’ which is well-balanced meal consisting of rice, soup, main dish and various side dishes. 'The Koggan' is a Korean Art Cuisine that pursuits philosophy and aesthetics of Sadaebu (nobility of Chosun Dynasty) with Korean cuisine expert, Jongguk Lee and conceptualized ‘feast on top of cloud’ meaning with spreading beautiful landscape of the 50-story. Moreover, this place is awarded as 2 stars of Michelin guide 2017 Seoul. 'All the morning (Semoa)’ is all day dining to fill the day with hearty menus cooked with fresh vegetables and local ingredients, just like we are awaken by mornings every day. Seems like every morning of the world has brought into one place, variety of brunch menu, salads, sandwiches, pasta, steak and wine are available. ‘The Promenade’ is a bespoke function hall where customers can constitute menus and space as they desire. Unlike traditional banquet or buffet menu, Menus can be selected from Korean cuisine, American style to semi buffet cooked with seasonal ingredients, to meet customer needs. Also, as atrium space can be decorated for variety of banquets, meetings, and weddings, this place makes things even more special with loved ones.
