								The Esperanto Association of Korea (Korea Esperanto-Asocio) is a member of the Universal Esperanto Association (Universala Esperanto-Asocio, headquartered in the Netherlands) and is an official advisory NGO of the UN and UNESCO contributing to communication and understanding between nations. The Esperanto Association of Korea endeavors to disseminate Esperanto within the country and in 1994 successfully welcomed and hosted the 79th World Congress of Esperanto (1776 attendees). The organization has selected Seoul the host of the 102nd Congress of the Universal Esperanto Association in 2017. Developed in 1887 by Dr. L.L. Zamenhof, a Polish physician and philologist, Esperanto is an artificial language designed to enhance mutual understanding and friendship between different ethnicities in a neutral fashion in order to promote international peace.
