        Mugyewon is a cultural space operated by the Jongno Foundation for Arts &  Culture. It is a converted yojeong (exclusive entertainment venue for high-ranking  government officials), originally bearing the name Ojinam. As such, it is a  place of great historical significance, having been host to many important national  events. One notable example is its role as the meeting place for the landmark  1972 ‘July 4th North-South Joint Statement’, during which the two Koreas explored  ways to improve their troubled relations. More recently, the building faced  demolishment until Jongno-gu district officials stepped in, with Ojinam being moved to a new location in 2010 and rebranded ‘Mugyewon’. Today, it serves  as a high-quality educational and cultural space, giving it a new lease of life  in modern Seoul.TransportationFrom Incheon Int’l Airport: 50~60 minSubway: Gyeongbokgung Station (Line 3), Gwanghwamun Station (Line 5)Nearby hotels & attractionsWithin 3km:  AVENTLee Hotel,  Doulos Hotel,  Tower Cloud     HotelWithin 5km:  JWMarriott Hotel, PresidentialAssistantHotel, Royal     Hotel
