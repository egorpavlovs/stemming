        Ara Art Center, located in Insa-dong, heart of Korean art and culture, was born to lead
and elevate the value of popular art through hosting various exhibitions.
A large capacity complex cultural space that is able to host exhibitions, performances,
events and parties simultaneously, Ara Art Center’s total floor area spans 1,500 pyeong
(4958.7m2) and there is a total of 9 floors (from B4 to 5F) with freely arrangeable
exhibition spaces that range from 40 pyeong (132.232 m2) to 180 pyeong (595.044m2).
The average height of exhibition halls is 3.5m and the maximum ceiling height is 14m,
enough to accommodate a wide variety of artistic endeavors. The beautiful natural
lighting that penetrates the 4 basement level floors complements the works on display
and helps to create a rich ambience. The Ara Art building has been constructed through
the effective use of concrete and glass, with the black concrete symbolizing water and
the luminous glass representing dawn on a horizon that stretches across the sea.
In the same way as how culture and civilization develops harmoniously, Ara Art is
a space that creates all components of Korean art and culture, and this is even reflected
in the material and exterior of the building.
