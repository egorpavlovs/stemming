		Gangnam Style: It's a rap and more 
		2012-09-06
		
			
			The Seoul Convention Bureau's Stephen Kwak recently spoke to Singaporean newspaper, the Straits Times, about the incredible phenomenon that is 'Gangnam Style', as performed by K-pop idol Psy.
"We are surprised that this music video has been so popular in the US market because we had never done that before. Korean pop stars are quite famous in Asia, but not in the United States. Most of the Koreans are quite excited."
Access to the Straits Times is subscription-only, but readers can see the full article on this blog.
