		Seoul Tourism Organization Begins Operation of New Gangnam Tourist Information Center
		2013-06-28
		
			
			
In response to growing interest in Seoul’s Gangnam district, a new Gangnam Tourist Information Center was opened on June 26th, and will be operated by the Seoul Tourism Organization. At the facility, international visitors will have access to a wealth of information on the famed Gangnam district, such as its high-tech industries, medical tourism, and K-Pop culture.
The center officially opened its doors on June 26th with a special ceremony attended by officials from the Seoul Metropolitan Government, Gangnam District Office, and Seoul Tourism Organization. Korean pop celebrities Super Junior were also in attendance for the event.
Speaking recently with STO staff, center manager Suna Lee said the new venue welcomed “all visitors in search of their own ‘Gangnam Style’ and looking for reliable information on medical and beauty themed tours,” adding that the district’s visitors “can now enjoy various experiential programs focusing on hallyu directly on the premises.”


Operated by the Seoul Tourism Organization in conjunction with Seoul Metropolitan Government and the Gangnam District Office, the center is set to help expand tourism infrastructure and the development of tourism products such as medical tourism and hallyu (Korean Wave) - a phrase coined to describe the global spread of popular Korean cultural exports such as television dramas and pop music, particularly in Asia.
Spanning two floors, the center’s 1st floor features a general tourism information desk offering services in English, Chinese and Japanese, medical tourism information center, travel agency, currency exchange, and facilities for making reservations, ticketing, luggage storage, and purchasing transportation cards. The 2nd floor, dubbed the ‘K-Wave Experience Zone’, provides hallyu fans with various interactive stations to enjoy their favorite Korean celebrities, including a Hallyu Star Experience Zone, Exhibition Zone, and a Beauty Zone.

The new center is located in Apgujeong, an area of Gangnam popular for its luxury shopping and medical facilities. Careful planning went into the choice of location, with the center strategically-placed close to Gangnam’s most in-demand tourism areas that besides Apgujeong include Garosu-gil in Sinsa-dong, famed for its galleries, cafes, and clothing boutiques, and the Cheongdam Luxury Brand Street, which will soon include a ‘Hallyu Star Street’.

The Gangnam Tourist Information Center is the latest of many tourism facilities operated by STO, including the Seoul Global Culture & Tourism Center in Myeongdong and a tourism information desk at Incheon International Airport - both of which serve thousands of visitors every year.
Gangnam visitors will find the Gangnam Tourist Information Center next to the Apgujeong branch of Hyundai Department Store. The Gangnam City Tour Bus, offering tourists an opportunity to explore the district in comfort, departs directly outside the entrance. A large parking lot for coaches and visitors renting cars has been provided for their convenience.
