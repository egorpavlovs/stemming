        Established in 1950, the National Theater of Korea has been the home of Korean 
performing arts for over half a century, presenting modern interpretations of 
traditional Korean works by affiliated companies such as the National Changguk 
Company, the National Dance Company, and the National Korean Traditional Orchestra. 
Since 2012, the theater has strived to present audiences with high quality, 
dynamic performances as part of its ‘Repertory Season of the NTOK.’ In addition, 
the theater holds various performances and regular functions for corporate events 
and celebrates its anniversary with various programs every year.
