			Seoul welcomes a major boost to its accommodation offerings today with the opening of the 5-star Conrad Seoul – a new Hilton for the capital, and its first-ever Conrad. The hotel is located within the central Yeouido district and forms part of the new International Finance Center (IFC) multi-complex. Designed to provide an intuitive, comfortable experience for travelers, the Conrad is expected to become a firm favorite with Seoul’s many international visitors.
The 434-room hotel features a variety of facilities for business events, including over 2,608m² of meeting space. The Conrad’s Grand Ballroom, which can be subdivided into three, can hold up to 800 persons, while the Park Ballroom can accommodate 400 persons.  The Conrad also features 11 other meeting rooms ideally-suited for mid-small size gatherings. Other facilities include a fitness center, three themed restaurants, a lobby lounge, and bar.
Guests will also find much to enjoy in the Conrad’s unique “Smart Luxury” concept, which has been described as a luxurious experience that is personally comfortable for the individual guest. The hotel will is equipped with specially-designed “Smart TV” service for guest rooms. Developed by Apple and DirectSystems, Smart TVs stream high-speed internet and can be operated by a customizable remote control designed to let guests choose how they wish to interact the technology.
“The Conrad is a very welcome and exciting new addition to Seoul’s meetings industry,” said Seoul Convention Bureau vice-president Maureen O’Crowley.
“We are very pleased by Hilton’s strong commitment to our city and we think guests will be too when they see what the Conrad Seoul has to offer.”
The Conrad is the third Hilton hotel for Seoul, the others being the 5-star Grand Hilton Seoul and Millennium Seoul Hilton, both located in the Northern ‘Gangbuk’ district.
