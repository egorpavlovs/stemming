	InterContinental Seoul COEX, Asian Live’s Newly-Appointed Arabic Chef Ahmad

		InterContinental Seoul COEX, located in Samseong-dong, has appointed a
new Arabic Chef to present Halal dining at our Asian Live restaurant. Hailing
from the Dubai Marriott Hotel and the Jordanian restaurant Petra, Chef M Am
Onism Ali Ahmad boasts an impressive 15 years of culinary experience.


Having graduated from a cooking academy in his home country of Jordan,
Chef Ahmad is a certified Arabic Patissier and Chef, which allows him to serve
traditional Halal dishes from various Islamic countries such as Lebanon, Syria,
and Saudi Arabia.

Halal in Arabic refers to things that are ‘permissible’ under Islamic
laws. Specially prepared beef, lamb, chicken, and other herbivorous animals
fall into this category, along with fish that have scales and most all fruits
and vegetables. Halal food has recently been gaining popularity in Europe among
people seeking healthy and delicious dining options. Certified Halal cuisine
makes up about 18% of the global food market.      

Chef Ahmad plans to serve hummus, beef and lamb shish kebabs, bamiya
(saffron rice and steamed beef with tomato sauce) and many other Halal Arabic
delicacies - exclusively at the InterContinental Seoul COEX’s Asian Live.Inquiries
