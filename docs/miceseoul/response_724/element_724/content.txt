	THE 2015 HILTON CHRISTMAS TRAIN!

ALL ABOARD THE 2015 HILTON CHRISTMAS TRAIN! 

 

18 November
2015, Seoul, Korea… It’s getting to be that
time of year again – and to help spread Christmas spirit and Yuletide joy to
everyone in Seoul, Millennium Seoul Hilton will unveil its Christmas Tree and
ever-popular Christmas Train on Saturday, November 23.  This year marks the twentieth anniversary of
this holiday tradition.

 

For the last two decades, every year a
grand 10-meter Christmas Tree is placed in the center of the main lobby to
welcome guests to Millennium Seoul Hilton and warm people’s hearts with
Christmas cheer.  In the Lower Lobby, designers
and engineers skillfully recreate a miniature village in the Alps, complete
with snow-capped mountains, tunnels, wooden bridges and hot air balloons.  The highlight, of course, for both children
and adults who are young at heart, is the Christmas Train, a collection of
around 75 exquisitely handcrafted locomotives and railroad cars that will chug
their way through the little village.  

 

The Christmas Train represents a
time-honored tradition at Millennium Seoul Hilton.  Now celebrating its twentieth year, the
unveiling of the Christmas Train marks, for many, the start of the Christmas
season, much like the Macy’s Thanksgiving Parade does in New York.   The spirit of Christmas is also remembered
as domestic and international companies are invited to sponsor railroad
cars.  All proceeds are then distributed
to Hyeshimwon Orphanage.  

 

The Christmas display will remain up for
viewing until January 17, 2016.  

For
additional information, please call Millennium Seoul Hilton’s Christmas Office
at (02) 317-3012.
