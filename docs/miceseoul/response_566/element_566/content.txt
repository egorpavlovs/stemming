		STO Relaunches and Welcomes a New Leader
		2018-05-28
		
			
			 Seoul Tourism Organization Relaunches and Welcomes a New LeaderPresident & CEO Jae-sung Rhee Will Hold Post  as the Head of the Seoul Tourism Organization for Three Years Jae-sung Rhee, former executive vice president of the Korea Tourism Organization, was appointed to become the first president and CEO of the Seoul Tourism Organization. President and CEO Jae-sung Rhee graduated from the Department of Spanish at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies and went on to receive his doctorate from Kyung Hee University's Graduate School of Tourism. He worked at the Korea Tourism Organization for 33 years from 1985 to 2017 and held the position of director in every department within the organization (Director of Management, Executive Vice President, Director of International Tourism and Marketing, Director of Domestic Industrial Affairs, and Director of Policy). With his hands-on experience and expertise, leadership abilities, and global sensibility, Jae-sung Rhee is regarded as an expert in the field of tourism. President Rhee officially joined the Seoul Tourism Organization on April 23, 2018, a week before the group officially relaunched under a different legal status on May 1, when it was restructured from a public-private partnership and government-invested corporation into a fully government-funded foundation. Now funded by the Seoul Metropolitan Government, the Seoul Tourism Organization has been reestablished to proactively respond to the rapidly changing tourism environment and promote Seoul tourism in a way that achieves the public interest and reflects professionalism and responsibility.  As an organization that specializes in city marketing, the Seoul Tourism Organization aims to bring more international visitors to Seoul by increasing the city's competitiveness in terms of tourism and MICE, as well as contribute to the economic development of Seoul through the revitalization of tourism-related industries. Going forward, the Seoul Tourism Organization is expected to strengthen its public function of promoting and leading the continuous development of the tourism industry under the direction of president and CEO Jae-sung Rhee.
