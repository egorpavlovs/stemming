								"B-boy Kung", the famous nonverbal B-boy performance held in the world's first B-boy theater, has been upgraded to "Kung Festival"!
The purpose of "KUNG" FESTIVAL is to report the seriousness of school violence and to prevent teenagers from the prevalent social phenomenon by suggesting the main theme: Friendship and Reconciliation.
The dynamic dancing and comic storyline performed by the talented dancers of SJ Crew will drive you excited. Listen to the "KUNG" sound (means "boom") made in your heart! The friendship, reconciliation, and the energy of youngers will touch your mind friendly and deeply as a universal language.
We plan to constantly upgrade this performance to provide the worldwide audience with the best contents in quality. Also, we are staging "a traveling performance" for local schools and social welfare facilities out of the B-boy theater.
