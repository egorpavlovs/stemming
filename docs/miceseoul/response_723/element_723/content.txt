“Festival of India” Begins in Seoul after Visiting France, 

Thailand and Hong Kong 

 

The “Bonjour India” Festival opened in France, traveled to
Thailand and Hong Kong, and will now come to Korea! Experience traditional
Indian cooking, yoga and dance workshops with a Bollywood film director from
November 9th until November 15th.  The ‘Festival of India’’ will take place in popular
Korean cities such as Seoul, Busan and Chuncheon.

 

The festival originally started as a cultural exchange event, but
after such a rousing reception by audiences in France, Thailand and Hong Kong,
the festival is now aimed at developing Asian Culture by collaborating with
Korea’s popular Hallyu culture.

 

At this festival, Vikram Udaygiri and Kasiviswanathan, famous chefs
working at one of India’s most acclaimed hotels, will introduce traditional
Indian cuisine at Millennium Seoul
Hilton.  Also, yoga specialist Abhijit
Ghosh from India will give an open lecture at Nami Island to help people
experience Indian culture. On top of that, Drums of India, an Indian Folk Music
Performance, ODISSI (Indian Classical Dance), and more will entertain audiences
with energetic performances.   

 

Sanjoy K. Roy, CEO of TEAMWORK and organizer of the festival,
expressed his hope that Korean people’s interest in Indian culture would grow.  He also sees the festival as a way for the
people of India to learn about Korean culture. 
 This international event, which
is organized by TEAMWORK (an Indian cultural promotion company), is sponsored
by the Indian Cultural Center Korea, the Embassy
of India in Korea, and Millennium Seoul Hilton, and will take place from
November 9th through to the 15th. 

 

During this time there will be several cultural events taking
place at Millennium Seoul Hilton including a special Indian Fine Dining Dinner at
Seasons, the hotel’s gourmet French restaurant, on November 10th.  On November 13th, there will be a
live Folk Music and Ishara Puppet performance for customers dining at Café
395.  The performance starts at 6pm. In
addition to this, there will be an Indian Food Festival in the evenings
throughout the month of November, and Indian treats will be available for
purchase at the Cilantro Deli. Enjoy Indian Chai and Korean High Tea in the
