        The Shuim Museum procures, preserves, and displays relics from the disappearing culture of funeral processions, and conducts ongoing research on traditional costumes and customs through annual seminars. As befitting its subject matter, Shuim aims to be a haven of peace and tranquility where one can contemplate life and death as it affects us in our daily lives. Through a program of special exhibits on ancient objects embodying anthropomorphic wooden sculptures, as well as dragon heads, goblins and the like that represent the immortality of the soul, museum curators attempt to offer a glimpse into the philosophy of life and death of ancient Koreans. Museum facilities are also available to the public for a range of events.TransportationFrom Incheon Int’l Airport: 50~60 minSubway: Gwanghwamun Station (Line 5) - 15 minutes by bus from stationGyeongbokgung Station (Line 3) - 12 minutes by bus from stationHongje Station (Line 3) - 10 minutes by bus from stationNearby hotels & attractionsWithin 5km: Grand Hilton Seoul
