		Seoul Offers New Prepaid SIM Card Service for Visitors’ Smart Phones
		2012-08-13
		
			
			It is now easier than ever for business travelers in Seoul to keep connected with friends, family, and co-workers back home – all while using their own phone. South Korea’s mobile phone service system has launched a new and streamlined prepaid sim card service for inbound tourists wishing to use their existing smart phones purchased overseas. The new option serves as a cheaper and more convenient alternative to existing roaming services and phone rentals
Currently, two options are available depending upon the length of stay. Stopover tourists in Seoul can have their current sim cards switched with a fully-functioning local Universal SIM card (USIM) by visiting the O2 Mobile center at the Coex City Air Terminal. Those planning to stay longer can opt for the “OLLEH Simple” prepaid sim card plan by visiting a KT Global store. All devices should be WCDMA and 3G compatible in order to qualify.
The City Air Terminal is conveniently located next to Coex, Seoul’s largest convention center, making it readily accessible for international conference and meetings attendees.
The prepaid service ensures visitors do not have to worry about any last-minute fees owed when departing the country. In addition, O2 Mobile international calls may be even cheaper than local calls, with calls to the US costing $10.00 per 138 minutes.
The unbundling of the country’s mobile networks in May 2012 is a welcome change for the local meetings industry, making it even easier for business tourists in Seoul for events to stay connected.
For more information about the O2 Mobile service, please email prepaidsimkorea@gmail.com or on (02)-539-4355. For more information about the KT service, please visit http://expatblog.kt.com or call (02) 2190-1180
