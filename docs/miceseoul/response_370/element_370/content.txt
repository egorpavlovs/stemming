Seoul
Museum is running by Seokpa Culture Institute, located at the foot of
northeastern Inwang Mountain, Buam-Dong, Seoul. Buam-dong is in between
Samchung-dong and Pyungchang-dong and is known as one of the fastest growing
places in the art business today. The museum discovers cultural and artistic
value in everyday life and opens not only various exhibitions, but also does
researching and planning various art programs. Seoul Museum aims to be a
dynamic place to lead cultural development in this generation. The museum is
not biased towards any certain genre, generation or style, but it introduces
eclectic streams in Korea and international. Moreover, Seoul Tangible Cultural
Property No. 26 “Seokpajeong” is located at the park of the museum. This was
built and used as a villa of a father of King Gojong in Joseon Dynasty.
Specifically, the 650-year-old pine tree located in the western yard of the
villa is protected by the Seoul Metropolitan Government and has shared its
destiny with Seokpajeong for several centuries. Seoul Museum and Seokpajeong
represent the mixture of the historical city Seoul and multicultural
backgrounds, past and present, and nature and humankind.
