                Pulkovo Saint Petersburg Airport has been named best in Europe 
            
            March 2 2016
        

        






        
            
                
                

Pulkovo Saint Petersburg airport won the prestigious Airport Service Quality (ASQ) Award, as announced by Airports Council International (ACI) on February 29. Pulkovo airport was ranked Best in Europe in the 5-15 million passengers per year category, in 2015.

“Today’s airport managers must respond to the passenger’s demand and expectation for superior customer service. Your airport’s results in the 2015 ASQ Survey demonstrate your professionalism, commitment, and success in delivering that high level of customer service”, said Angela Gittens, Director General of ACI World, in her congratulatory letter to Pulkovo airport.

Throughout 2015, Pulkovo airport was ranked among the best European airports in terms of overall passenger satisfaction in ASQ quarterly surveys. In the third — most intense — quarter of the year, Pulkovo airport became the leader of the ranking among more than 90 airports in Europe.

The ACI ASQ Survey is a unique comprehensive global benchmarking program that measures passenger satisfaction and performance excellence of over 300 airports around the world. The Survey covers 34 key service areas and includes 8 major categories such as access, check-in, security, airport facilities, food and beverage, retail, way finding, and overall satisfaction.

The ranking is based on surveys for passengers in the participating airports, which use all the same survey questions. The ACI experts form the survey sample plan for each airport in such a way that it includes passengers from all travel segments from flights on all 7 days of the week and all parts of the day. Participation in the Survey allows the airports to track and analyze their performance, as well as benchmark results against airports across the globe, prioritize improvement opportunities, and manage change effectively. 

Airports Council International was founded in 1991. ACI represents airport interests with governments and international organizations such as ICAO, develops standards, policies and recommended practices for airports, and provides information and training opportunities to raise standards around the world.
