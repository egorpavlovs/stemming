Saint Petersburg International Legal Forum will be held in the Eastern Wing of the General Staff Building of the Hermitage Museum on May 18-21. The event is organized by the Ministry of Justice with the support of the President of the Russian Federation.

Each year the Forum brings together ministers of justice, chairpersons of constitutional courts, secretary generals of international organizations, heads of leading legal firms, chief legal officers of major companies, representatives of state regulators, international organizations and legal schools from over 80 countries. One of the traditional tasks of the Forum is to offer its delegates an opportunity to identify models for solving most complicated legal issues and share best practices for establishment of a favourable business environment and development of responsible entrepreneurship.

In 2015 over 3500 delegates from 84 countries took part in the Forum, including the delegates from Australia, Argentina, Belarus, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, Mexico, New Zealand, South Korea, Ukraine, United Kingdom, United States and Vietnam. Over 400 members of the media representing more than 100 organizations, including leading federal information agencies, TV and radio broadcasting companies, printed and online media, were accredited to cover the Forum in 2015. The Forum hosted over 30 media events. More than 20,000 people from 60 counties followed the discussions online.

This year’s Forum attracted special interest of the banking community, investment funds and other financial structures. This year’s agenda features several major sections dedicated to the matters of mutual influence of business and law. The Forum will host several bespoke events sponsored by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.

As always, the Forum will host the award ceremony titled Contribution to the Development of Legal Integration in the Eurasian Space. Its goal is to promote legal integration within the EEU, Customs Union and Common Economic Space, and foster legal cooperation at an international level.
