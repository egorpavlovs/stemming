Saint Petersburg is represented by the Saint Petersburg Convention Bureau (SPbCB) at CIBTM show in Beijing this year.

SPbCB has been established as an independent organization just one year ago, however, Russian tourism industry’s attention has been fast riveted to China region for many years. The China-Russia business, economic and cultural relationships has been demonstrating ongoing raise in every field. Over 1 mln. tourists from China visited Russia last year with 2015 forecast for even more. The Government of Saint Petersburg – most-visited Russian city – makes every effort to make the city most-welcoming for guests from the Celestial Empire: visa requirements facilitation, direct air access development from major Chinese cities, business and cultural centres development. It is not so long ago since Saint Petersburg joined the national program for more comfortable environment creation for travelers from China known as “China Friendly”.

At CIBTM 2015 SPbCB is to present the city’s unique opportunities for business meetings planners such as historical venues, exhibition centres, congress venues, hotels and entertainment options.

The destination presentation is being held August 5th @16:00 in the seminar hall at the fairgrounds. You can also meet SPbCB CIBTM 2015 team at our booth F286 any time during the show.
