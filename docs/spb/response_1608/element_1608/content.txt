Saint Petersburg’s rain did not manage to frighten devoted lovers of high-quality music, who visited international jazz festival Usadba Jazz on Elagin Island on July 11.

The event was held in Saint Petersburg for the 4th time. There were three concert venues, where performances took place, and genres varied from traditional jazz to indie-folk. This year new scene was introduced, called Best Of The Hat, supervised by the front man of Billy’s Band Billy Novik.

Fivefold owner of Grammy, legendary pianist Chucho Valdes, who can artistically combine latin-american motifs and jazz idioms, introduced his solo project Irakere. Keyboardist Nik Bärtsch and drummer Mark Gillian, who is known for his performances with David Bow and Brad Mehldau, were among other famous artists. Russian musicians, participants of TV project Golos were also there: Mariam Merabova, George Ufa, Anton Belyaev.

Except from good musical program, food court, sport ground, master classes and workshops on the venue for both children and adults were organized.
