Saint Petersburg International Legal Forum has finished its work. This year it was attended by 3750 people from 77 countries, including Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Israel, Italy, Japan, Singapore, Switzerland, UK, Ukraine, USA.  

This year, 71 official foreign delegations attended the Forum, eight Ministers of Justice and twelve Deputy Ministers became honored guests of the Forum. The events of the Forum were attended by the representatives of international organizations, including the heads of such long established international institutions as World Intellectual Property Organization, Venice Commission of Council of Europe, Hague Conference on International Private Law, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL), International Institute for the Unification of Private Law and Supreme Courts: 34 delegations, 23 of which were represented by Chairmen and Deputy Chairmen.

Over 500 participants made speeches within the framework of a business program of the Forum. 40% of them are foreigners, 60% of them are Russian participants. Among the visitors there were renowned academics and experts in different branches of law. Among the speakers at the plenary session there were Dmitry Medvedev, Prime-Minister of the Russian Federation, Francis Gurry, Director General of World Intellectual Property Organization, Steve Crown, Vice President of Microsoft, Miriam Naor, President of Supreme Court of Israel, Yury Fedotov, Under-Secretary-General of the UN - Executive Director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, Theresa Cheng, Chairperson of Hong Kong International Arbitration Center and others.

“The international task of the Forum is to show our legal system the way it actually is, and not the way it seems to us from the screens of TV-sets. Many foreign participants get surprised – they thought differently about our country, they had a worse image of our legal system,” said Yury Lyubimov, State Secretary – Deputy Minister at the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation.

The business program of the Forum included more than 70 events, including conferences, presentations, lectures, as well discussion sessions, divided into seven thematic blocks: private law, industry, trade, and competition protection, court and arbitration practice, smart society, investments and finances, international law, safety and the rule of law, legal profession.

As Yury Lyubimov said, the Forum is a platform for the discussion of current trends. “The Forum is not a place, where lawyers learn, but a place, where they communicate and identify new trends. This is exactly why we always try to choose topics that are not only relevant today, but will be relevant even tomorrow,” summarized State Secretary – Deputy Minister of Justice of the Russian Federation.
