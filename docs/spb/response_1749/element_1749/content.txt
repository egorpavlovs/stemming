The worldwide exhibition for incentive travel, meetings and events IMEX will be held in Frankfurt on May 19-21. Saint Petersburg Convention Bureau is among participants of the event.

The exhibition will be the biggest since its launch in 2003. 3500 exhibiting companies from 150 countries present achievements and services of national tourism agents and departments, major tourism bureaus, hotels, congress centres, health resorts and travel destinations, airlines, event organizers and operators. With demand from hosted buyers continuing to strengthen year-on-year will be arriving in Frankfurt as part of the almost 4000 strong programme.

The IMEX congress programme will offer 170 education sessions providing valuable information and insight on Business Skills, Marketing and Communication, Risk Management and Compliance, Technology & Social Media, Trends and Research. There will be new early morning sessions on Business Networking and Building Confidence. Two new session formats will be geared specifically towards Young Professionals – for anyone with up to 3 years industry experience - and Senior Professionals – for anyone with 8 years experience or more. Also new this year within the education programme is Creative Thursday featuring engaging interactive sessions such as how to form effective partnerships with suppliers and advice on event design. The health and wellbeing seminars will cover areas such as mindfulness in events, the importance of good posture and staying healthy while travelling. There is also a new wellbeing initiative - ‘Be Well at IMEX’. This is designed to help buyers to stay healthy and rejuvenated during their busy days at the event. In addition a new Meditation Room offers classes such as yoga, relaxation and guided mediation to help attendees re-energise between appointments.

If you would like to appoint a business meeting with representatives of Saint Petersburg Convention Bureau in advance, please contact us by mail info@saintpetersburgcb.com. The number of the stand is G400. See you soon in Frankfurt!
