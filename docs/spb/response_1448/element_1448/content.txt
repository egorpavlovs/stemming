Representatives of universities and leading companies in the business meetings industry have met at the strategic session on September 29 to discuss the education system for result-oriented managers. The event was held with the participation and the support of Saint Petersburg Convention Bureau.

The meetings industry feels crisis impact today. Industry players need to highlight the quality in the situation when industry loses quantity indexes. Saint Petersburg Convention Bureau, attracting large-scale international events, should have a choice of venues, operators, means of accommodation that comply with high world standard. The quality of this database depends on personnel affairs. As CEO of Saint Petersburg Convention Bureau Anna Chetvergova reported, they planed to undertake a research in order to determine and correlate the requirements of the industry and the capabilities of the universities for the training of relevant professionals.

The international project “EURDIC: the quality and the competitiveness of specialists in the business meetings industry” helps to decide which programs students should learn. Universities from Russia, Latvia, Great Britain, Cyprus, and Kyrgyzstan take part in the research. The work prolongs until 2017, intermediate results will be presented at the Europe + Asia Event Forum on January 2016. The project covers areas of European Union, Russia and Kyrgyzstan. Its aim is to engineer positions and occupational standards in the tourism and to draw up programs of upgrade qualifications for professionals and teachers.

Event managers should have knowledge about convention sphere and the sector of the economy which event organized by them is dedicated. However the practice plays the main role. Vice-president of Leningrad Region Chamber of Commerce and Industry Dmitry Prokofiev mentioned as an example France where all practical part of the education is shaped through tasks.
