RAO/CIS Offshore, 12th International Conference and Exhibition for Oil and Gas Resources Development of the Russian Arctic and CIS Continental Shelf, is held in Saint Petersburg. It is the event with a twenty-year history, which attracts leading Russian scientist and the world’s largest oil and gas companies annually.

In 2015 RAO/CIS Offshore prepared the wide exposition and the extensive congress program. The sessions will focus on the exploration and development of deposits on the Arctic and Far Eastern shelf, the regulatory framework design construction and operation of offshore, systems, industrial and environmental safety in extreme conditions. The possibilities of effective international cooperation in the Arctic and Far Eastern shelf are one of the important topics of the discussions.

The holding of RAO/CIS Offshore in Saint Petersburg is highly important. “The biggest part of shipbuilding, energetic, instrument plants is situated in our city. They provide proper fulfillment of the state programs of the Arctic development and energetic safety of the country”, - Vice-Governor of Saint Petersburg Sergey Movchan highlighted.

The conference and exhibition will be held until September 18.
