                Saint Petersburg Claims the Right to Hold the World Food Travel Summit in 2019

                Saint Petersburg claims the right to hold the World Food Travel Summit in 2019.


It has been shortlisted one of the three candidates, along with Macau, the Chinese administrative region, and San Juan, the capital of Puerto Rico.


Dmitry Levykin, the Deputy Director of City Tourist Information Bureau of Saint Petersburg, says, "Voting to select the city host is to take place in Portugal in April. According to the bidding procedure, representatives of the event organizing committee and the World Food Travel Association are coming to the city with the site inspection to assess Saint Petersburg’s capacity to conduct such an event".


One thousand experts are expected to attend the one week summit; taking into account that an average business tourist brings in approximately $1500, the city’s economy will benefit $10 million from the event.
