1st of November was declared in Russia as day of mourning in connection with Russian plane crash in Egypt.

All 224 people aboard were killed early Saturday when the Airbus A321 crashed in Egypt's Sinai peninsula shortly after takeoff from a popular Red Sea resort town. The flight, carrying 217 passengers and seven crewmembers, was en route from Sharm El-Sheikh in Egypt to Saint Petersburg when it dropped off radar screens 23 minutes into the flight. According to the preliminary information, most of people aboard were from Saint Petersburg.

Convention Bureau expresses heartfelt condolences to families and friends of killed passengers and crewmembers.
