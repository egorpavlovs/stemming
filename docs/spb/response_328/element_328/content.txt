                    Pavlovsk Palace and Park
                
            

        
            
                
                    
                
            

            
                
                    The palace and park ensemble Pavlovsk was created in the age of Russian classicism of the late 18th - early 19th centuries by the constellation of famous architects and decorators of the time: Charles Cameron, Vincenzo Brenna, Giacomo Quarenghi, Pietro Gonzaga. The works of art purchased or ordered by the owners of Pavlovsk, as well as received as gifts from the monarchs of Europe during the trip of 1781-1782 are placed within the palace halls. The vast collection of paintings, porcelain, bronze, furniture and sculpture is presented in the palace interiors. Among these masterpieces are works of Peter Paul Rubens, Charles-André van Loo, Ivan Petrovich Martos and Hubert Robert. Tastes of Pavel Petrovich and his wife Maria Feodorovna are reflected in the planning of the landscape park: its picturesque natural scenes along the banks of Slavyanka river, Arcadian and classic pavilions give Pavlovsk the reputation of a romantic park. This place inspired poets, artists and composers. Johann Strauss used to give concerts here. For more than two centuries Pavlovsk, this great joint creation of man and nature, have been granting enchanting feeling of harmony and spiritual balance to people. This world heritage masterpiece is protected by UNESCO. The palace and park ensemble has unique venues for arranging business meetings, teambuilding, presentations, conferences, seminars as well as gala receptions.
