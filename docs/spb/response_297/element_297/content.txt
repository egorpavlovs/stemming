Saint Petersburg is famous as a dominating force in promoting cultural evolution, keeping and enriching the classical music traditions. Many renowned composers, representing the best of the best in classical music, were either born or lived on the banks of The Neva. The spirit of Saint Petersburg, it’s grandeur and rich historical and cultural heritage – this is what inspires the creative people to open up their talent and share their magic with others.

The art director of The Saint Petersburg Musical Theatre Zazerkalie, People’s Artist of Russia, professor Alexander Vasilievich Petrov – “this city has always been filled with music: from the whispering of the Neva waves to the frozen music of its squares and architectural ensembles, from the straight geometrical lines of Vasilievsky Island to the baroque architecture of Smolny Cathedral; it is ringed by a river that is the river of music.

The Music on The Neva Festival is aimed at promoting Saint Petersburg as the global tourist, cultural and art centre. This major open-air music event is set to become a good tradition and another significant event of Saint Petersburg: it will be annual, boosting its presence and extending the geography of its guests and performers.
