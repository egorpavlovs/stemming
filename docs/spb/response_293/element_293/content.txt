                St. Petersburg won the bid to host the World Congress of The World Association of Chefs' Societies, and left behind Lyon and Sydney in the final. Venice of the North has confirmed its status as a Europe cultural and business center, becoming the most attractive destination for the major gastronomic event in the world.

The international competition was announced in 2015, St. Petersburg was nominated to the final after  consideration of the twelve destinations bids. The final competition took place within the Worldchefs Congress 2016 in Thessaloniki, Greece on September, 27.

Saint-Petersburg’s presentation was prepared by the Convention bureau and included tasting Russian pancakes with various fillings, promotional stand construction, and video about the city. Particular emphasis of presentation was both on the culinary theme – St. Petersburg restaurants and cafes, cooking processes, environment protection, food companies, and  on the activities of the Russian Culinary  Association – own projects, support of young professionals, Chef a la Russe, and participation in international projects.

The Worldchefs Congress is a key event of the World Association of Chefs Societies, WACS – the most authoritative international organization of professional chefs. The first Congress was held in Paris in 1928 and there were 65 delegates from 17 countries. Since then, the Worldchefs Congress is held biennale in different cities and countries. Congress was held on all continents for 88 years: Milan, Vienna, Brussels, Melbourne, Auckland, Singapore, Kyoto, Kuala Lumpur, Dubai, Jerusalem, Johannesburg, Santiago de Chile, Orlando and dozens of different cities. Over the past 20 years, Congress has expanded and now it gathers up to 2500 delegates from more than 60 countries.

Despite the fact that Russian cuisine, as well as Russian professional culinary traditions are well known all over the world, our country is one of the few that have never hosted the Worldchefs Congress.

Hosting the Congress in St. Petersburg will enhance the image of the city as a destination; it will increase tourist flow by attracting business travelers, as well as provide additional inflow of funds in the city budget. Moreover, traditionally the Congress events are widely promoted by world Mass Media.

Hosting Worldchefs Congress in St. Petersburg is very important for the development of a new tourist direction – gastronomic tourism.
