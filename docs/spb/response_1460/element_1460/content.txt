                Saint Petersburg will host the seminar of the European Society of Contraception in 2017 
            
            September 11 2015
        

        






        
            
                
                

Saint Petersburg has won the competition for holding the seminar of the European Society of Contraception and Reproductive Health (ESC) in 2017. This became known on September 4.

The contest was announced in April 2015. Saint Petersburg Convention Bureau took the initiative in attracting the seminar to the city and approached the Russian Association for Population and Development with the proposal of common work in this regard. The organization supported the idea completely and helped to fill the application form from Saint Petersburg. As the result the city on the Neva River became the winner of the tender being ahead of the candidate from the Estonian association and other competitors.

The choice of the European Society of Contraception and Reproductive Health is the first victory of Convention Bureau responsible for attracting large-scale business events to Saint Petersburg. It is worthwhile noting that the result was achieved within few months after the start of the participation in the competitions of international professional associations. It is considered as a short period in world practice.

The seminar of The European Society of Contraception and Reproductive Health was held for the first time in 1991, now it is held every three years. The cities with a strong science potential such as Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam, Warsaw, Belgrade, Tel Aviv, became venues for international science cooperation and discussions on actual medical topics. Despite active work of institutions in the field of contraception and reproductive health Russia has never hosted events of the society.

The seminar attends traditionally over 500 delegates – practicing specialists, academics, representatives of public organizations. The event will create a positive environment in Saint Petersburg for the development of medicine, science, the improvement of healthcare system, the increasing of birth rate, the consolidation of industry community. The seminar will be held in September 2017.
