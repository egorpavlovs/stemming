Saint Petersburg continues to develop the water transport. Aqua buses work for citizens and tourists in the summer navigation times.

The route Primorskaya line passes along Neva and Bolshaya Nevka Rivers from Universitetskaya Embankment to Primorskiy Prospect. It is the fastest way to reach the modern ecofriendly district with many parks from the city centre. The driving time occupies only 15 minutes. In comparison this distance by metro requires 35 minutes and by car – one hour and more.

Aqua taxis make seven stops located near by city sights. The route is divided into two zones: from Primorskiy prospect to Arsenalnaya Embankment and from Arsenalnaya Embankment to Universitetskaya Embankment. Aqua buses run every 15 minutes in working days from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., in weekends and holidays – from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. The transportation costs 100 rubles through every zone, 200 rubles – through all route in working days, in weekends and holidays – 150 and 300 rubles consequently.
