                The Grand final of the most prestigious global awards in the travel industry, the World Travel Awards, was held in Noonu Atoll (Maldives) on December, 2. Saint Petersburg won one of the titles of “World Travel Awards”.

Hundreds of industry leaders recognised Saint Petersburg as leading tourist and culture destination and awarded the city with the title "World’s Leading Cultural City Destination 2016".

The leading tourist centers of the world, such as Beijing, London, New York, Paris, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Sydney and Venice fought for the title of leading cultural city destination along with Saint Petersburg in the Grand final.

World Travel Awards President Graham Cooke said: “Saint Petersburg is rightly considered as "World’s Leading Cultural City Destination 2016”. A number of tourists visiting the city with cultural and cognitive purposes constantly increases. The city is promoted actively on the world stage”.

Andrey Mushkarev, Chairman of the Committee for Tourism Development of Saint Petersburg, said: “Saint Petersburg is now at the peak of its popularity. The city has won the most prestigious award in tourism. The northern capital of Russia hosts a large number of cultural and business events each year and this is recognition of our growing significance in hospitality. It is the result of city authorities’ work in terms of Saint Petersburg promotion as a world tourist destination”.

In September 2016 Saint Petersburg was recognised as Europe’s Leading Destination by the World Travel Awards  and as the results of the European selection came in the Grand final.

The World Travel Awards were founded in 1993. World Travel Awards are considered as the top achievement in the tourism sphere. Annually prizes are given after thousands of experts and tourists voted for a candidate. The selection priorities are safety, extensive infrastructure and hotel chain in destination. 

The awards have been called the "Oscars" of the travel industry by The Wall Street Journal.
