                Petersburg ranked by Resonance as one of the top 100 cities in the world
            
            February 21 2019
        

        






        
            
                
                Saint Petersburg is one of the best cities in the world, according to a ranking of the 100 best-performing cities around the globe released last week by a North American consulting company.

Resonance Consultancy, a global advisor on tourism and economic development for countries, cities and communities, has announced their 2019 “World’s Best Citie,”. While the 'Venice of the North' could not beat out cities like London and Paris, Petersburg did end up ranked 54th overall and ninth in the institutions, attractions and infrastructure category.

The World’s Best Cities ranking is the most comprehensive city ranking on the planet, based on entirely original methodology that uses the opinions of the people who matter most: visitors, investors, talent and residents. The program was developed to quantify and benchmark the relative quality of place, reputation and competitive identity for the world’s principal cities with metropolitan populations of one million or more.

The ranking analyses and compares 24 factors in six key categories using a combination of core statistics and online ratings and reviews, from TripAdvisor reviews, Facebook check-ins, Google searches and Google Trends. This helps cities understand their strengths and weaknesses through the lens of the people who visit and live in each city.

Bloomberg calls Resonance Consultancy’s Best Cities ranking “the most comprehensive study of its kind; it identifies cities that are most desirable for locals, visitors, and businesspeople alike, rather than simply looking at livability or tourism appeal.”
