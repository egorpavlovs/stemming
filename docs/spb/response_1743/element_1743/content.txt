The moderator of the discussion was General director of Convention Bureau Anna Chetvergova. She said that tourist flow to Saint Petersburg amounted 6,3 million people in 2014. The number of international travellers fined down, the number of Russian tourist increased.

General director of Hospitality Management Blake Anderson-Buntz gave an interesting hotel statistics. Premium was the worst segment during crisis. Small hotels 4* were the most sustainable by loyal and return customers inside country.

Viktoria Pechenkina from JSP Travel shared her supervision about MICE-destinations. Turkey, Greece, Montenegro, Italy were high-demand in 2014. Crimea, Sochi, Georgia, Abkhazia and Armenia are the most popular now.

Could events be independent centers of tourist attraction? Representatives of festivals Message to Man, Jazz Spring, Paints of Childhood, Trails of Health with 40 000 participants shared their opinions about it. Night of Museum which united 100 000 people this year discussed too.

Classic Saint Petersburg remains the tourism driver. However the city will be more attractive with a big number of events, festivals, creative spaces, smart services and environment.
