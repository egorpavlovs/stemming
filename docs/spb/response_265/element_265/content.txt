                Saint Petersburg has been included into top ten of the world's 50 greatest cities

The Telegraph has compiled the ranking of the world's 50 greatest cities that must be visited in 2016. Saint Petersburg has been included into top ten for the first time - on the 8th place. Moscow closes the list.

The ranking has been made following the results of the voting by more than 75,000 the Telegraph’s readers. Saint Petersburg is the biggest climber in the ranking – may be down to the BBC’s recent rendition of War and Peace. That grand gallery, the Hermitage, is proof that the Tsar’s capital is still regal.
