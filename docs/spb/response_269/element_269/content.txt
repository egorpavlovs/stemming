                Chief Editor of Meet and Travel Mag: “It’s the time to visit Saint Petersburg!”

Chief Editor of Meet and Travel Mag Michel Foraud and Associate Director Patrick Monnier visited Saint Petersburg within the press tour on May 12.

The aim of the trip was to meet MICE peculiarities for preparing an article about the city. Representatives of Meet and Travel Mag visited CEC Expoforum, Lomonosov Porcelain Factory, Jacobson Ballet School, Library of Voltaire, Hotel Astoria and Four Seasons, the Naryshkin Mansion and other venues. They enquired with Saint Petersburg Convention Bureau for receiving actual information about market situation and prospects for further development of local MICE industry. Representative of Bureau gave them all needed facts and figures, told about priority working fields and asked a question about the readiness of meeting planners from France for holding events in Saint Petersburg.  

“The French likes your city, first of all, for its culture and architecture. I personally love it especially in the winter, when all around freezing, snowy and beautiful, and no lines in museums are. Before it was enough expensive to come here. However, the situation was changed cardinally, thanks to the rate of the ruble. It’s the time to visit Saint Petersburg!” said Ms. Foraud.
