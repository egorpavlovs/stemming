"The forum is almost 4 months cultural life in the cultural city,–  he said. - Today, I am pleased to welcome the Russian delegation and representatives of Germany, United Kingdom, France and other countries. It is significant - sanctions don't matter to people that build cultural ties."

Vice-Governor of St. Petersburg Alexander Govorunov noted that St. Petersburg residents are very proud of the fact that the city is considered the cultural capital of Russia. "And it's true: for the fifth time we hold the cultural forum, which has become a platform for communication between artists, the business community, the authorities, - said Alexander Govorunov. - In a friendly atmosphere, open discussions, we are discussing the development of world culture". Alexander Govorunov added that culture has always been a kind of basis for social and economic development.
