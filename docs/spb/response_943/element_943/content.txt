Representatives of Convention Bureau presented Saint Petersburg at Convene, the Exhibition for Meetings, Events and Incentives in Vilnius on February 10-11.

It’s the key event for the Baltic Sea Region. The project was held for the fourth time and hit the records of the previous years. 170 hosted buyers from 27 countries arrived to the capital of Lithuania. Over 3600 appointments over the two days of the event have been pre scheduled. Saint Petersburg took part in the event for the first time and aroused a high interest from the side of visitors and other destinations of the Baltic Sea Region.

The task of Convention Bureau at Convene was to present Saint Petersburg as business tourism and MICE destination and to explain advantages of the holding of events here. Meetings with buyers were held according to the pre-shedule which was fulfilled almost 100%. Specialists of Convention Bureau conducted over 50 negotiations at Convene in total. Organizers of incentive tours prevailed among visitors of Saint Petersburg booth, in particular from the Great Britain, Poland, Germany, Baltic Sea countries. It was unexpected to learn for them that a night in a 4 star hotel costs an average 50-60 euros in Saint Petersburg. These prices are significantly below than in the EU, therefore, become a major factor for increasing the flow of foreign business travelers to the city. Meetings with representatives of non-corporate sector demonstrated their awareness about priority industries and upcoming major events in Saint Petersburg. Sport professional associations were interested in the holding of events before the FIFA World Cup Russia 2018, medical unions conducted negotiations with a view to a potential support of strong local community.

Business oriented character of meetings and high interest of the buyers in Saint Petersburg allows to evaluate the results of the exhibition in Vilnius positively.
