However companies can derives profits not only from business events. 2018 FIFA World Cup will be held in Saint Petersburg. It means the possibility for operators to supply packet services with tickets and organize cultural program for fans, families and friends of football players.

The competition will allow to forecast the trends of consumer preferences during 2018 FIFA World Cup, but it is interesting not only for this reason.
