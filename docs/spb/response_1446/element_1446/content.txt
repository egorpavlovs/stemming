                The discussion of convention bureaus at the Otdykh MICE conference
            
            September 24 2015
        

        






        
            
                
                

CEO of Saint Petersburg Convention Bureau Anna Chetvergova took part in the International Meeting Industry and Business Travel Exhibition and Conference Otdykh MICE in Moscow on September 15-18.

The theory and the practice of the MICE development at the domestic market, the consolidation of efforts of the state and the business community became the topic of the open dialogue. Representatives of convention and tourism bureaus from Yaroslavl, Samara, Sochi shared their opinions and ideas. Anna Chetvergova represented Saint Petersburg at the meeting.

Delegates discussed the strategic plans of the development of cities, implementation tools, problems of Rissian regions. As Anna Chetvergova said, three factors such as the geography, infrastructure and support of the city, determine the success of tourism and convention destination.  The position of Saint Petersburg by these points is beneficial but there are resources for its improvement. 72-hours non-visa regime for participants of business events and the decrease in value of air tickets could provide an additional flow of business tourists to the city. 

Meetings and tourism are fast-growth industries, and specialists need to get knowledge reguarly. Employees of Saint Petersburg Convention Bureau participate in the federal educational project. Sales manager of Bureau Olga Petrenko will go for the study to Barcelona, the Forum of Young Professionals in November.

The program of the session included the issue about the quality of infrastructure and service.  The classification of hotels is running by 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia in Saint Petersburg. Convention Bureau of the city accomplishes the function of the informational and statistical centre. It means that the organization collects the database of city infrastructure objects and classifies their by relevance for holding event with consideration for international standarts.
