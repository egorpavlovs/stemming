                    <p>We are pleased to invite academic and university researchers, foreign scientists, pharmaceutical and medical business representatives, postgraduate students and students to XXI Mendeleev Congress on General and Applied Chemistry which is to be held in Saint Petersburg, Russia, September 9th - 13th, 2019.</p>

<p>Every 4 to 5 years, Mendeleev Congress welcomes scientists from all over the globe to the scientific and cultural centers of our country for discussing the groundbreaking scientific and industrial achievements in chemistry. Mendeleev Congress is recognized as the largest Russian scientific event focusing on fundamental and applied chemical research.</p> <p>The congress traditionally maintains an interdisciplinary program that highlights new research directions as well as advances in chemical industry and professional education. In addition to scientific discussions, Mendeleev Congress specifically features the networking among business, industry and academy.</p> <p>The Program of XXI Mendeleev Congress will broadly cover almost all disciplines of chemistry both in its national and international aspects: chemical synthesis methodology (including synthesis of new super-heavy elements with high stability and chemical agents with unusual structures and promising properties), nanomaterials and nanotechnologies, structural and functional materials, biomolecular chemistry and biotechnology (including biocatalysis and biosensor analysis), molecular electronics, supramolecular chemistry, electrochemical power engineering, alternative energy sources and engine fuel from plant raw material, new methods and devices for studying chemical processes and substance analysis. Round-table sessions will focus on the actual problems of chemical technologies. The Congress provides a unique environment that promotes collaboration among scientists and chemical engineers to encourage the development of cutting edge research and technologies.</p>

<p>2,200-2,500 participants are expected to attend the XXI Mendeleev Congress, including 300 scientists from abroad. The Congress offers advertising and sponsorship opportunities for Russian and foreign innovative companies to promote their business and chemical products.</p> <p>We are looking forward to seeing you in Saint-Petersburg!</p>
