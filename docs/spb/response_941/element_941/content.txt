                Saint Petersburg Convention Bureau participates in MICE exhibition IBTM Arabia
            
            February 4 2016
        

        






        
            
                
                

Saint Petersburg Convention Bureau will participate in the Exhibition for Business and Corporate Tourism IBTM Arabia. The event will take place in Abu Dhabi on February  9-11.

IBTM Arabia is interesting for several reasons. Firstly, Middle East is a significant resource MICE market. Every year more and more local companies organize business events and incentive trips outside the region. Representatives of the Saint Petersburg Convention Bureau saw this trend during the visit to Arabian Travel Market in Dubai in the last year. Secondly, the dynamic development of the United Arab Emirates as a MICE-destination provides a great interest from industry professionals and clients of the business and corporate tourism to specialized events held in the country. In 2012, Abu Dhabi is rapidly broke into the top 100 of the world ranking ICCA, which was a real breakthrough compared to 234 the year before. Thirdly, it is the business-oriented format of the event. 20-minutes meetings between exhibitors and hosted buyers are held according to the pre-schedule here. Buyers are selected by organizers based on several criteria, including purchasing power, the number of meetings held in the Middle East and other regions, the annual budget for MICE. In 2015, representatives of agencies in the organization of business trips, incentive programs, the DMC-companies amounted 73 per cent of the participants of Hosted Buyers Program, 16% belonged to the corporate sector, and 11% - to the non-corporate. Half of buyers were from the Middle East market, 25% - Europe and Russia, the rest was distributed between America, Asia Pacific and Africa.

According to a survey on IBTM Arabia, 95% of exhibitors gave a positive assessment of the qualitative composition of the Hosted Buyers. Over 3 thousand face-to-face business meetings were held during the exhibition in 2015, and now it is planned that this number will grow up to 4200. The schedule of business meetings with representatives of Saint Petersburg Convention bureau has been already fulfilled by almost 100%.

Professional speaker and a well-known motivator Carol Talbot will inspire the participants of IBTM Arabia to the successful work. She will speak about leadership strategies and secrets of success. Apart from the official part, there is planned reception and white party, which will allow participants not only to have a good time, but also to establish the necessary business contacts.
