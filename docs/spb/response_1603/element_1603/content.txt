Do you know what’s in common between China and Russia? Vast territories, great cultures and, of course, tea.

Tradition of drinking tea in Russia is closely bound with the Chinese culture. It came to Russia in the beginning of the 17th century after first expeditions to undiscovered China.

The Russians liked the taste of tea immediately, especially black leaves sorts of the drink. It used to be made in a particular way, on a samovar* which used to be placed as a centerpiece on a table. The tradition had it the more the samovar was, the richer was the family. People preferred to drink tea with sugar and lemon, and always served varenije*, honey, Russian traditional pastries bubliki* and baranki*. Tea-drinking used to take several hours with dozens of cups of tea being drank. But the most important thing of the whole ceremony was mutual cordial communication with family and friends.

We are here kindly invite you to find yourself in warm atmosphere of the Russian hospitality, taste the flavor of tea brewed with an authentic samovar and of traditional Russian confectionary! A memorable souvenir is also guaranteed! Would you like to know what kind of a souvenir it is?

Do join us August 5th @16:00, booth F286, and you will find out!
