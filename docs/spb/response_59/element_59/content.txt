                Gourmet Days in Saint Petersburg
            
            June 7 2017
        

        






        
            
                
                This summer St. Petersburg will see the launch of the international food festival Gourmet Days, as part of the city’s White Night celebrations. From the 4th to the 8th of July, Russia’s culinary capital will for the first time be hosting four days of eating, drinking and culture.

The festival will open with a barbecue and cocktail party followed by a series of nine dinners. Each dinner will be created by two leading chefs; a local chef from Russia will be joined by a visiting chef, esteemed amongst the international restaurant scene. Each evening will conclude with a decadent after-party, continuing until the early hours. These unique dining experiences will take place at various locations across the city, showcasing a plethora of flavours and culinary styles. From fine dining to hearty home-style gastronomy, Gourmet Days caters for all palettes.

Confirmed St Petersburg restaurants taking part in the event include Volga-Volga, Мansarda, GODJI, The Repa, Gastronomika, Skotniy dvor, TartarBar, Smoke BBQ, BeefZavod, Moroshka dlya Pushkina, Hamlet + Jacks, Big Wine Freaks and many others yet to be announced.

Using locally sourced produce from family run farms and markets has always been an integral part of Russia’s culinary identity. The northern capital of Russia has a rich gastronomic history and this venture aims to bring a new generation of talented chefs into the limelight whilst re-establishing St. Petersburg as one of the world’s leading foodie destinations.

The project partner will be the gastronomic whisky The Singleton from the heart of Scotland, which traditionally will offer the perfect combination in food pairing format performed by talented chefs. The best ingredients in creative combinations – the simple pleasures that have become the hallmark of The Singleton.
