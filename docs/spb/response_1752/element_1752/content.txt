Representatives of Convention Bureau have returned from Frankfurt. They presented Saint Petersburg at the Russian stand of the Worldwide Exhibition for Incentive Travel, Meetings and Events on May 19-21.

''IMEX is the exhibition where event professionals from over the world arrived. We had the unique opportunity to meet clients and colleagues of convention bureaus from different cities, explore best practices of destination promotion, make an experience exchange, build new cooperative projects,'' commented General Director of Convention Bureau Anna Chetvergova.

Nearly 9,000 hosted buyers and visitors who came to participate and do business at this year’s show took part in over 62,000 individual appointments, stand presentations and group appointments.

The IMEX congress program included seminars providing valuable information on marketing and convention destination promotion, increasing of business event effectiveness, industry trends, and press conferences.  The winners of professional competitions were announced at the exhibition. Marina Bay Sands in Singapore was awarded the IMEX/GMIC (Green Meeting Industry Council) Green Supplier Award. A software company from Ottawa, Canada, InitLive won Event Technology Startup Competition. The firm has developed an all-in-one software solution for event staff and volunteer management on mobile devices.

The meeting of ICCA Members (the International Congress and Convention Association) was held at IMEX. ICCA CEO Mr. Martin Sirk presented strategic plan of the Association and announced the launch of ICCA database updated design.

In addition a new Meditation Room offered classes such as yoga, relaxation and guided mediation to help attendees re-energise between appointments at the venue.
