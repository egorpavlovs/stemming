                Saint Petersburg International Legal Forum: about law in changing time
            
            June 2 2015
        

        






        
            
                
                

V International Legal Forum has finished its work. The event was held in Saint Petersburg on May 27-30.

The event became one of leading international platforms for discussions about actual legal issues during its staging.  Legal Forum 2015 hosted over 3000 guests from 84 countries. Heads and Deputy Heads of key international organizations visited the event. United Nations, European Court of Human Rights, Court of the Eurasian Economic Community, Eurasian Economic Commission and many others were among them.

Within round-tables delegates discussed how international and private law must change in globalization time, which issues legal community confronted with, how legal education must be transformed. Internet, jurisdiction of crafts from different states, regulations in the intellectual property sphere did not remain without attention of lawyers.

How should we separate law from politic influence? How should we lead the world to unified understanding of legal norms? International legal system has to save its stability despite crisis of international relations. Such conclusion was sounded at the forum.
