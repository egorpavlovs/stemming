                    <p>Underground urbanization as a necessary condition for sustainable urban development.</p>

<p>The ACUUS conference 2016 is organised on behalf of Associated research Centers for the Urban Underground Space, one of the leading organisations involved into underground space development of the modern metropolises.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ACUUS conference series has been held previously in Sydney (Australia, 1983), Minneapolis (USA, 1986), Shanghai (China, 1988), Tokyo (Japan, 1991), Delft (The Netherlands, 1992) , Paris (France, 1995), Montreal (Canada, 1997), Xi&rsquo;an (China, 1999), Turin (Italy, 2002), Moscow (Russia, 2005), Athens (Greece, 2007), Shenzhen (China, 2009), Singapore (2012), Seoul (2014).</p>

<p>The Conference in Singapore, ACUUS 2012, welcomed more than 370 participants from 35 countries and numerous guests. More than 350 papers from 30 countries were received. The Scientific Committee, including world leading specialists, selected 159 papers from 26 countries for presentation. These papers made together 26 parallel sessions on planning, architecture, safety, sustainable development. The programme of the conference included training seminars on planning and safety. There were 5 technical tours.</p>
