                    <p><strong>The 9-th International Symposium &ldquo;Molecular Mobility and Order in Polymer Systems&rdquo;</strong> held in St.Petersburg, Russia, on June 19-23, 2017. The Symposium is under the sponsorship of IUPAC.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Symposium is one of the most important international polymer meetings in Russia. It continues a serie of Symposia organized by the Institute of Macromolecular Compounds of Russian Academy of Sciences and titled alternatively as &ldquo;Molecular Mobility and Order in Polymer Systems&rdquo; (I - 1994, III - 1999, V - 2005, VII - 2011) and &ldquo;Molecular Order and Mobility in Polymer Systems&rdquo; (II - 1996, IV - 2002, VI - 2008, VIII - 2014).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The main aim of the Symposium is to bring together scientists and young researchers, as well as scholars, working in the field of polymer chemistry and physics to exchange and share their experience and research results. Special attention will be focused on the functional and &ldquo;smart&rdquo; polymer systems and their properties important for applications in the engineering, electronics and biomedicine. Traditionally for this symposium complex stimuli-responsive nanostructured and &ldquo;soft&rdquo;-ordered polymer systems preserving a pronounced molecular mobility will be considered.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Symposium program will include about 20 plenary lectures, oral presentations and poster sections.</p>

<p>One day seminar/summer school &ldquo;Multiscale simulations of polymer and polyelectrolyte systems with complex architectures&rdquo; will be organized as a training event by EC FP-7 International Staff Exchange Scheme (project POLION).</p>
