                Andrey Mushkarev, the Chairman of the Committee for tourism development, congratulated guests and participants in the opening ceremony of Visit Petersburg office in Beijing.

The opening of the first overseas Visit Petersburg office was held on October 27 on the base of information and business center, served to disseminate information about Saint Petersburg, to promote the competitive advantages of our city to foreign markets, strengthen international and foreign economic relations, as well as to promote our city as a tourist destination.

"Today the international relations between China and Russia are at a high level, cooperation between the cities of China and Russia develops in various fields. On behalf of the Committee for tourism development, we work hard to maintain the quality of tourist services. This year a lot of work on the reception of Chinese tourists has done in St. Petersburg: information signs around the city and in airport were translated into the Chinese language, as well as the menu in many restaurants, and transport infrastructure develops. There are more than 200 accredited Chinese guides-translators in St. Petersburg. Tourist’s safety and comfort are the priority for our city. To serve tourists in St. Petersburg there are the offices of "City tourist information Bureau", which employees speak Chinese language, due to this, guests of the Venice of the North can easily get the information about the city, about sights, routes, and also the necessary assistance in their native language.

The work done by St. Petersburg Government is bearing fruits. Every third tourist is a citizen of China, every year the number of tourist flows from China and in China is growing rapidly. Today, the number of Chinese tourists arriving in Saint Petersburg is more than 150 thousand people. The current trend in tourist traffic and the work, that work that has been completed by Russia and China, I can say, that next year the tourist flow from China will grow to more than 200 thousand".

Andrey Mushkarev thanked colleagues of the Russian and China airlines, which make a significant contribution to the development of tourist exchange between our countries.

"In addition to improving conditions for the tourists reception, the Committee together with the Russian tour operators develops new routes. In 2017 the 100th anniversary of the great October Revolution will be celebrated. In this regard, the Committee for tourism development is developing new routes to Revolution places. Tourists keen on history, will be able to learn the revolutionary past of St. Petersburg and Russia. In addition, the St. Petersburg Government is actively developing winter tourism. Winter tourism has a number of advantages for partners from China - the hotel rates are much cheaper, theatre and concert season in the winter even more eventful, there are a number of festive events dedicated to Christmas and New Year. Winter Saint-Petersburg looks like a fairytale city, and we would love to show this fairytale to our friends", - said in his speech Andrey Mushkarev.

At the end of the speech, Mr. Mushkarev has expressed confidence that with the opening of the first international office of Visit Saint Petersburg in Beijing, our and Russia will become even closer to our Chinese friends.
