                The number of hostels will grow up by 20% in Saint Petersburg

Saint Petersburg is named as Russian capital of hostels, and it is not coincidence. The first hostel in Russia was opened in the city on the Neva River in 1992, a year later a hostel appeared in Moscow. Today Saint Petersburg gets ahead of Moscow by the number of budget guest locations, and Saint Petersburg hostels dictate the trends throughout Russia.

Saint Petersburg Convention Bureau has taken the own census of hospitality objects without including apart-hotels and departmental hotels. The first phase of the research has showed that 1162 locations were registered in open information sources in June 2015. 738 among them are small hotels with 3-50 guest beds, 300 – hostels. The middle and big hotels occupy remaining 28% of the market. 

According to experts’ opinion, the number of hostels in Saint Petersburg will grow up by 20% by 2018. The Chair of the Committee for Tourism Development Inna Shalyto remarked that the opening of new small hotels and hostels where young tourists could stay was very actually for the city, especially before 2016 World Hockey Championship and 2018 FIFA World tournament. Really large-scale festivals and events often bring burst in development of budget guest locations. Similar situation at the market was shortly before and in the year of 300th anniversary of Saint Petersburg.

The erosion of the purchasing power of Russians and the refocusing of the tourism to domestic destinations create the positive environment for the development of hostels. In 2014 the number of tourists from another regions of Russia who visited Saint Petersburg grew up by 10% and amounted 3,5 mln. people. On the other hand the trip to the Northern Venice became more affordable for foreigners in the current economic situation. Many of them even business tourists uphold the democratic view to the trips and consciously choose hostels. The most communicative travelers like the home atmosphere of hostels and opportunity to make easy new friends.

Besides foreign young people and budget tourists from Russia, employees on work trips are among potential clients of hostels. Some mini-hotels develop event stream and propose venues for holding of meetings and small exhibitions that can increase the audience of their guests.

Of course big hotels maintain leadership by the proposed room supply in Saint Petersburg. But the capacity and the significance of hostels must not be underestimated. According to the opinions of the experts among their clients are 60-90% foreigners.
