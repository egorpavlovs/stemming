                    <p>The aim of holding Citywide Professional-Mastery Competitions is to elevate the prestige and profile of vocational occupations and specialisations, encourage the professional orientation of schoolchildren, popularise the advanced experience offered by vocational training, attract parents&rsquo; attention to the training of a skilled labour force within the city&rsquo;s vocational education system, assist in the employment placement of high-school graduates, and interest young people in getting involved in the real sector of the St. Petersburg economy.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Step Towards My Future Profession&rdquo; competition will encompass contests across the 40 most sought-after professions, specialisations and competencies on the St. Petersburg labour market and in the local economy. The competitions will feature the participation of 350 students from secondary vocational-education institutions.</p>

<p>The students will showcase their skills in woodworking, carpentry, milling work at CNC workstations, the culinary arts, fashion design, the floral arts, hairdressing and much more. In order to support the work of the various competitions, more than 200 people have been invited to serve on the respective judges&rsquo; panels as experts &ndash; workers from local enterprises and organisations in St. Petersburg, masters of vocational training, instructors in specialised disciplines, and production department supervisors.</p>

<p>Students attending the city&rsquo;s many general-education schools will have the opportunity to acquaint themselves with the substance of professional occupations, take part in master classes, and undergo vocational testing. The kids will also be able to get information about the activities of vocational institutions administered by the St. Petersburg Education Committee and the respective admissions and study rules.&nbsp;</p>
