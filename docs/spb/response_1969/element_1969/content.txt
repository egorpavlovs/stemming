                    <p>International ecological Forum &quot;Baltic Sea Day&quot; now has acquired the features of a large international event.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Annually, over the last fourteen years, in March, on the shores of the Neva come representatives of all countries of the HELCOM and other European countries to discuss the problems of the Baltic region. Acute environmental issues on the agenda of the HELCOM and the Baltic as a whole are not discussed anywhere else with such a participatory, academia, parliamentarians, and public structures, as is happening at the Forum &quot;the Baltic Sea Day&quot;. Baltic States NGOS, scientists, politicians can hear here not from the mouth of the official delegations, and apart from all those who are working directly for the benefit of the environment. The Forum not only exchange of views, but also seeking joint agreed solutions. The fact that it is not always possible to resolve as part of official delegations, could be discussed at the Forum, which provides the possibility of informal dialogue. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Forum one can imagine a sort of public hearings on the priorities of the Baltic Sea, at which all interested parties shall be notified for complete information on the issues covered all aspects of cooperation, given the opportunity to ask each other the most acute questions and get the answers.&nbsp;<br />For the restoration of the environment of the Baltic Sea coastal countries all share responsibility. Only together, combining their efforts, it is possible to make the Baltic Sea more environmentally friendly and healthy.</p>
