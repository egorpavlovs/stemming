The headliner of Saint Petersburg Convention Bureau Industry Day, Managing director of TMF Dialogue Мarketing Germany & India Johanna Fisher shared their opinion about the event.

St. Petersburg 's new Convention Bureau successfully hosts first industry gathering with around 100 players from the local meetings industry!

I had the pleasure of designing and facilitating the CVB's first industry day after its inaugural year of operation on Friday, December 4 in beautiful St. Petersburg. Both officials as well as a selection of the local meeting industry suppliers joined a 5 hour interactive workshop on creating a "smart city" Convention Bureau and improving the co-operation among each other. The aim was to clarify both needs and the kind of contribution and responsibility the industry is willing to share to speak with one voice when it comes to the international promotion of the city. The day was overwhelmingly lively, interactive and spirited, with many participants contributing greatly to the outcome of identifying areas of challenges, brainstorming about a local Ambassador program and finding new ways to co-operate in the future.

While St. Petersburg still faces needs for infrastructural and service improvements, the city has a huge treasure chest of unique assets for international meetings and any kind of corporate events. The currency rate is extremely favourable for non-Russians and the city's atmosphere is magic as always. With the new Expoforum Congress Centre there is all it needs to cater for the most advanced expectations of congress planners and the industry is willing to support at every level. New venues like the Fabergé collection's home in the Shuvalov Palace or the renovated parts of the Hermitage complex, now presenting a unique mix of modern architecture in old environment, with an airy auditorium and world-class exhibitions provide a special glamour that cannot easily be found elsewhere.

As said Inna Shalyto, Chairwoman of the St. Petersburg Committee of Tourism Development in her welcome speech: " we aspire for a great future in the global meetings space and will do everything it needs to be at the top of global congress cities in a few years". With visum conditions being a bit rough, she promised to work hard on creating special conditions for congress participants to get a visum-free entry for the length of their congress, to minimize bureaucratic obstacles and follow the most contemporary approach to destination marketing, which is based on knowledge and expertise in the destination and other aspects of the "smart city"  concept and on story-telling content marketing.

St. Petersburg's key industry clusters cover among others shipbuilding, aerospace, automotive industry, radio-electronics, pharmaceuticals and medical industry as well as software & information technology services. Universities in the city ad with their international experts to key knowledge and research, so for example in the Arctic Antarctic Research Institure or in many technically oriented universities. A great basis to start from when it comes to bring international congresses to the city.

At the end of the day, the group work between the attendees resulted in identifying claims, where everybody can comfortably feel being part of - we presently vote in an online poll for the preferred message, which will then be taken forward in communication, as first sample of a crowd-sourced joint message of the St. Petersburg meeting industry and their new CVB!

Special credit goes to Anna Chetvergova, the director of the St. Petersburg CVB for her hard work and open mind! Thanks everybody for a great start into better co-operation!
