                The International Festival of Events and Live Communication EUBEA 2016 was held under support of Committee for Tourism Development and Saint Petersburg Convention Bureau in Saint Petersburg and marked the best event projects of the year.

More than 460 participants from 22 countries arrived in Saint Petersburg to showcase the best events of the year and to be inspired by creative energy. The short-list included 114 projects, along with 15 Russian projects. The festival has become the largest for its entire 11-year history.

"I am sure that this momentous event will attract the attention of international business community to St. Petersburg as to a center of event and business tourism, – said Andrey Mushkarev, Chairman of the St. Petersburg Committee for tourism development. The festival has definitely become a platform for experience exchange between leading experts of the industry events in Europe and Russia. Along with it allows to strengthen the partnership between our countries and to increase business opportunities of both Russia and Europe".

Authoritative judges included event industry experts, along with Olga St. Petersburg Convention Bureau CEO. They selected best 32 projects. The selection took place in two stages. The first was online voting, the second – live presentation to judges. Russia submitted 15 projects: "Scarlet Sails", the “Circle of Light” Moscow international festival and several commercial projects.

The most resounding was the victory of the St. Petersburg event. "Scarlet sails" was recognized as the best city holiday in Europe, and also awarded silver in the category "Сultural event".

To receive a major European award in the field of event marketing – the Golden elephant – finalists were tested on 4 criteria: creativity, execution, strategy, communication channels and efficiency. The team presented and defended the festival "Scarlet sails", brought its project to the final in five categories.

Hosting one of the most significant awards of the global event industry in St. Petersburg, as well as the recognition of "Scarlet Sails" as the European Best Event, mean that the St. Petersburg  for tourists from all over the world is interesting not only for its heritage, and our city continues to strengthen its position as event and convention capital of Europe.
