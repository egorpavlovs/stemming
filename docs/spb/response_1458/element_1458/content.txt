Saint Petersburg will become the first Russian city where World Conference of Associated research Centers for the Urban Underground Space will be held. The event will be attended by leading underground urbanization specialists all over the world from 12 to 15 of September 2016 in the Park Inn by Radisson Pribaltiyskaya hotel.

The 15th World Conference ACUUS is an event of a global scale in the field of underground construction. It has been held successfully for more than 30 years in many cities of the world. Seoul, Singapore, Shenzhen, Athens, Turin, Montreal, Paris hosted the event previously.

 Specialists, industry experts, investors, representatives of the authorities and public organizations will participate in the conference to discuss urban planning of underground space for comfort living, historic centers preserving, improving environmental situation, geotechnical and  hydrotechnical technologies, the investment appeal of underground structures and other topics. The exhibition displaying underground infrastructure projects, the international competition of students works, technical tours are planned within the event. As expected the conference will gather over 500 delegates.

Saint Petersburg is a city of unique architecture, representing world best design traditions. The image of the city and infrastructure are results of its specific history of construction. The land of Saint Petersburg is known for its high impact of urbanization on geological environments. Urban underground space contains a large number of structures of different assignments (underground rapid transit system tunnels, wastewater disposal, sewers). City has difficult geological and geotechnical conditions due to waste distribution of unsustainable watered grounds, quick-response to industrial impact. For these reasons the themes of the conference are high important for Saint Petersburg.

The networking at the conference will facilitate the international cooperation in the field of underground construction and the development of common projects.
