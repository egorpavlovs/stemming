Convention Bureau will present Saint Petersburg at the Worldwide Exhibition for Incentive Travel, Meetings and Events that will take place in Frankfurt on April 19-21.

The cinema is the cross cutting theme for decoration of the booth and city marketing. The fact is that 2016 is declared as the Year of the Movie in Russia. Cinematograph has a special significance for Saint Petersburg as cultural capital of Russia where the oldest Russian cinema studio is located and where every street can serve like decorations for shooting. Within IMEX meeting planners can watch animated films by Russian directors including cartoons by Konstantin Bronzit, the nominate for the Academy Awards 2016. Delicious popcorn and drinks, permanent attribute of going to the cinema, complement cinema screenings. Saint Petersburg cinema hall at IMEX is the first event by Convention Bureau in support of the Year of the Movie. The theme will be continued later at IBTM World in Barcelona.  

Presentations of Saint Petersburg as MICE destination are planned during three exhibition days in Frankfurt. Representative of Convention Bureau will tell about specialized venues for holding business events, support programs for meeting organizers, and will share original ideas for incentive tours. The schedule of business negotiations at Saint Petersburg booth formed by IMEX online service is totally planned for one-to-one meetings with incentive companies and professional associations.

Nine PCO and DMC companies will work at Saint Petersburg booth alongside with Convention Bureau. In summation 3500+ exhibitors, 4900+ trade visitors and about 4000 Hosted Buyers will participate in IMEX. Organizers have prepared a package of networking events and a varied business program. Two major themes sound as the Sharing economy and Business is Personal.

Saint Petersburg booth is G400.
