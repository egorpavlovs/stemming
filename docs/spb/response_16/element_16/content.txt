                General Director of the Congress Bureau took part in the Assembly of Women-Entrepreneurs
            
            March 5 2019
        

        






        
            
                
                On March 4, the Assembly of Women-Entrepreneurs was held in St. Petersburg. Organized by the « Business Peterburzhenka» association, the event was attended by representatives of St. Petersburg government, deputies of the Legislative Assembly of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, representatives of the business - community of St. Petersburg and of other regions of Russia.

General Director of Convention Bureau of Saint Petersburg Committee for Tourism Development Andrei Matsarin took part in the plenary session of the Assembly. Other speakers included Galanina Freeman Maria Tuulikki, external relations specialist of Petersburg Medical Tourism Agency, director of the Joint Directorate of «Orenburg» and «Shaitan-Tau» State Nature Reserves Rafilya Bakirova, director of the Pskov Centre of Support of Enterprises Svetlana Zhuravleva, general director of «Elena Tsvetkova Jewelry» Elena Tsvetkova, curator of the «Second Breath» project Irina Shuvaeva, and head of the department of the «Department of Employment of Citizens with Special Needs» Irina Kuznetsova.

Andrei Matsarin has delivered a speech, in which he thanked the Association for the work being done to promote women's entrepreneurship in St. Petersburg and shared some insights preparations for the preparation for the 23rd General Assembly of the World Tourism Organization, which will be held in Petersburg on September 9-13, 2019.

According to the General Director of the Convention Bureau, the UNWTO General Assembly in St. Petersburg will have a "powerful positive effect" in different directions at the same time.

“The Assembly will attract approximately 1,500 delegates - members of the UNWTO - 158 countries of the world, many of which will arrive in our city for the first time. They will visit our city as business travelers, who, according to the International Congresses and Convention Association (ICCA), spend an average of $700 per delegate per day, which is three times more than a regular tourist. Based on the ICCA statistics, holding the Assembly in St. Petersburg will benefit the city’s budget and bring an estimated 30 to 40 million rubles in taxes,” said Andrei Matsarin.

Additionaly, the Assembly will have a positive impact on the image of not only St. Petersburg, but the Russian Federation in general.

“By attracting the attention of the general public to the tourist potential of St. Petersburg and the regions of Russia, the event will have a direct impact on the increase in tourist traffic,” he added.

During the speech, Matsarin also noted that the General Assembly will provide an excellent opportunity for the development of the commercial sector. Despite of the fact, that it is a closed event, UNWTO is interested in interaction with partners from various fields. That is why the official program of the Assembly contains sponsored events, within which representatives of St. Petersburg business structures will be able to develop mutually beneficial cooperation with both the organization and other companies.

“We are now working on a new business forum, The Saint Petersburg Travel Hub, which, in parallel with the UNWTO business program, will help to present the tourist potential of the regions of the Russian Federation to the UNWTO delegates. The forum will discuss important issues of current trends in the tourism business, in particular IT technologies in tourism, as well as the development of medical tourism.”

Maria Tuulikki, specialist in the external relations at the St. Petersburg Medical Tourism Agency, told in more detail about medical tourism in St. Petersburg. In her speech, she noted the Agency's experience in providing “turnkey” tours, allowing “to leave all worries associated with the organization and focus on treatment and rehabilitation”.

Among the advantages she also highlighted: close cooperation with state and private leading medical organizations in St. Petersburg, the ability to directly enter into an agreement with the clinic, free services of specialists in the selection of treatment programs and clinic selection, hotel booking, arranging transfer and patient support at all the stages of the treatment.
