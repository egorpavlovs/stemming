                Saint Petersburg hosts Symposium of the European Astronomy Consortium
            
            May 13 2016
        

        






        
            
                
                

Symposium of the European Astronomy Consortium (European VLBI Network - EVN) will be held for the first time in Saint Petersburg on September 20-23.

The Symposium will take place in the Saint Petersburg Scientific Center, located in the heart of the city. The latest scientific results and technical developments on Very Long Baseline Interferometry with the EVN and related facilities around the word will be reported and discussed. Scientific sessions will include the life cycle of matter in stars and galaxies, AGN and cosmic star-formation, Extreme Astrophysics, Astrometry and Geodesy, planetary and space science, as well as techniques and developments. The programme will also include the EVN Users Meeting, which is an important forum for interaction between the EVN users and the EVN organization.

Consortium organizes the event one time per two years. The destination is selected by the European VLBI Network Consortium Board of Directors. United Kingdom, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Germany, France, Netherlands, and Italy hosted symposium at different times since 1993.

Traditionally, about 120 scientists-astrophysicists participate in the symposium. Organizers in Saint Petersburg expect to attract more delegates thanks to the strong local science community.
