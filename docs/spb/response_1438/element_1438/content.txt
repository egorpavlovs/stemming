                Technologies of the future at the Saint Petersburg International Innovation Forum

Passing ahead of tomorrow – this is the motto of the Saint Petersburg International Innovation Forum. The event is held in Expoforum on October 7-9.

Technology of the future is something that seemed absolutely unreal yesterday. Every visitor of the forum will get a chance for hands-on experience with it. Saint Petersburg International Innovation Forum demonstrates unmanned polar all-terrain vehicle, diagnostics of a myocardial infarction in the early stages, solar-powered jet packs for astronauts and other progressive projects. This year, guests of the forum will witness the video of opening word by the Governor of St Petersburg right from the pages of the printed program book, and view photo and video report by the end of the event on its cover.

The program of the forum includes over 65 events. The third day is traditionally for youth and is dedicated to start-ups, youth entrepreneurship and innovation infrastructure.

Over 2600 delegates from 15 countries and experts from 20 states take part in the forum. Traditionally Saint Petersburg International Innovation Forum is held jointly with the forum “Russian Industrialist”. Number of visitors of these events amounts 10 000 people annually.
