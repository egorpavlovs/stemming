                Saint Petersburg is expecting an increase in number of tourists from China
            
            July 15 2015
        

        






        
            
                
                

The round-table discussion Tourism in Saint Petersburg: challenges and prospects of interaction with China took place in Saint Petersburg Board of Trade and Industry on July 10. The representatives of Committee for Tourism Development and Conventional Bureau were there.  

The Deputy Chairwoman of Committee for Tourism Development Rimma Sachunova opened the round-table discussion. She reported that, according to the statistics of Rostourism in 2014, 1 million 125 thousand Chinese arrived in Russia, among them 409 thousand for the purpose of tourism (286 thousand arrived as a part of non-visa touristic exchange). 36,3 thousand tourists entered through border crossing points of Saint Petersburg and North-Western Federal District, among them 25,9 thousand for the purpose of tourism. Consider that this statistics covers only those who cross the border in the city. While dozens of thousands arrive in Saint Petersburg from Moscow.

 

These figures can be even higher, emphasized Rimma Sachunova, taking into account the work of Committee on participation in Chinese exhibitions, organization of road shows and journalistic press tours from China. On August 5-6 members of Conventional Bureau are going to represent Saint Petersburg on CIBTM in Beijing.

Chief Commercial Officer of Northern Capital Gateway Evgeny Il’in reported that flights between Saint Petersburg and China cities comprise 0,34% of the whole passenger flow in Pulkovo airport, and there is a potential for a huge increase in numbers. During summer season 2015, direct flights from Beijing, Shanghai and Ürümqi are functioning. The flight from Lanzhou with technical stop in Ürümqi opens on July 16.

Deputy CEO of ExpoForum International Andrey Pavlov drew participant’s attention to the work of Chinese Business Centre, which was opened on March 7 and received about 30 official delegations from China. 

Executive officer of non-commercial partnership for the development of incoming tourism in Russia from APR countries World Without Borders Svetlana Pyatihatka presented program China Friendly. This project combines and accredits accommodation facilities, sights, exhibition objects, touristic companies, restaurants, shopping malls adapted for tourists from China.

The meeting ended up with signing the memorandum about mutual understanding between Committee for Tourism Development and World Without Borders.
