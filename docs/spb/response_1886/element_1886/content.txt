                The Importance of Being a Team
            
            January 23 2015
        

        






        
            
                
                Saint Petersburg Government Committee for Tourism Development discussed with the top managers of the meetings industry companies of Saint Petersburg the issues of building solid partnerships.

Inna Shalyto, the Chaiman of the Committee for tourism Development of Saint Petersburg, presided at the business breakfast with the heads of the key companies of the meetings industry of the city to discuss the ways of collaboration to bring more business events to the northern capital.

The business breakfast was a part of the Europe+Asia Event Forum 2015 taking place on Friday January 23rd. Among the participants of the discussion were Maksim Meiksin, the Chairman of the Committee on Industrial Policy and Innovations, Anatoly Kotov, the Chairman of the Committee on Economic Policy and Strategic Planning, Vladimir Katenev, the President of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Saint Petersburg, Svetlana Kogan, the Deputy Chairman of the Committee on Investments, Martin Sirk, ICCA CEO, Sergey Trofimov, the president of the exhibition company Restec, and other officials.

Building of a team of business representatives and policy-makers as the key aspect of successful development of the meetings industry and business tourism of Saint Petersburg was the main issue of the informal meeting.

Today, Saint Petersburg is #80 in the ICCA destination ranking - far behind the leading positions. Considering the ambitious goal of beating the ratings and getting into the Top-10 in Europe and Top-20 in the world before 2020, Saint Petersburg is to walk quite a laborous path the end of which can be successful providing the systematic coordinated actions of all the stake-holders.

In the end of the business breakfast the participants had a mutual agreement on providing overall support to companies and organizations of Saint Petersburg taking part in international bidding processes to ensure winning positions of the city's bids that would help Saint Petersburg take its well-deserved position among the world-leading congress destinations.
