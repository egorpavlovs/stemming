Baltic Coast Travel Forum has been held in Gdansk, Poland on September 22-23. The event has united industry decision makers of the region – over 180 participants and 30 speakers. Saint Petersburg Convention Bureau has been among them.

The Baltic countries are renowned for the distinctive cultural richness, the historical heritage of their cities, and the attention to the environmental conservation. It is highly important to improve relations in the region. The synergy of efforts will help to maintain a high interest of tourists and to increase indicators of the tourist flow. The participants of the forum have discussed the creation of a united tourist Baltic center. The maritime policy as a basis for the growth of tourism in coastal zones is another theme of the event. The factor of cooperation is important here. It will provide a transnational sustainable development.

The session dedicated to the meeting industry has held a special place in the program. There are over 25 convention and tourism bureaus in the Baltic region. Key work tasks were very close for all of them, including Saint Petersburg Convention Bureau. The business tourism is the future of the industry as concluded the participants of the forum. Over 25,000 European professional associations are constantly looking for new cities for their meetings. The economic effect of holding business events is expressed in significant figures. For example it is estimated at 130 million euro in Finland, 1 262,6 million PLN in Poland, 898 million euro in Vienna. It creates 27 473 working places in Poland and 17 259 in Vienna.

The uniting of efforts of the tourism community and the development of transnational innovative projects furthers the promotion of the Baltic region that is the main goal of the Baltic Coast Travel Forum. Next time it will be held in autumn 2016 in Parnu, Estonia.
