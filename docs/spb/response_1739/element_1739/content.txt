One of the most spectacular fest the Senior Prom Scarlet sails was held in Saint Petersburg during the magic white night from June 20th to 21th. About 80 000 school leavers from Saint Petersburg, different regions of Russia and near abroad countries took part at the celebration this year.

Governor of Saint Petersburg Georgy Poltavchenko congratulated yesterday’s schoolboys first. He named them “the best” because “they proved it the perfect study and the respect to Saint Petersburg”.

Festive events were placed at the Palace Square and the Spit of Vasilyevsky Island. School leavers were lucky to see the great multimedia show dedicated to the history of Russia and concerts of Russian stars. The breathtaking show of fire, water and light to music by Stravinsky, Mussorgsky and Tchaikovsky was held on the Neva River. The appearance of the brigantine with scarlet sails became the most emotional event moment. Swedish brigantine Tre Kronor played the role of the dream ship for the sixth time. The fest was ended with the fireworks as the symbol of bright future.

The Scarlet sails was celebrated for the first time in Saint Petersburg in 1968 and organized annually for 10 years. The symbolic fest was revived in 2005. As traditionally it is held in the weekend near to the longest June day.
