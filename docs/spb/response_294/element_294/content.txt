                The first ethnic festival "Music of the World" started in the Sheremetev Palace, Governor of St. Petersburg Georgy Poltavchenko and Chair of St. Petersburg Committee for Culture Konstantin Sukhenko visited the Opening Ceremony.

The theme of the first festival is "Siberia – North-West". Buryatia, Tyva, Altai and Karelia are the regions where incredibly powerful national traditions are preserved, however they successfully integrate into the modern music.

The festival organizer, the St. Petersburg State Museum of Theatre and Music, has one of the world’s five largest collections of musical instruments. At the festival "Music of the World", the instruments will sound in a full voice not as museum exhibits but as living and vibrant elements of the infinitely various musical mosaic of the world. 

The festival "Music of the World" is an opportunity to learn the culture of different peoples and to discover the variety of musical styles. The festival will be held till August, 27.
