                Pulkovo St. Petersburg Airport to host the first 'Silk Sky' aviation forum
            
            February 22 2019
        

        






        
            
                
                October 2019 will see Saint Petersburg, Russia, host the first 'Silk Sky' forum, a major new aviation initiative to deliver new flight links, services and hubs across Eurasia. Global Travel Investments Ltd (GTI) will organize the new annual event, and the inaugural forum will be co-hosted by Pulkovo International St. Petersburg Airport, one of Russia’s busiest and Europe’s most rapidly growing airports.

‘Silk Sky’ is a unique new air transport and networking forum aiming to add significant value to the present 'Belt and Road' strategy linking Asia, Central Asia, Russia and Europe. To date, the initiative has focused on developing surface and sea transport links to stimulate economic development across the Belt and Road. ‘Silk Sky’ will deliver civil aviation as a critical third element in the transport mix. With 80 countries and 63% of the world’s population living in the Belt and Road region, representing one third of the global economy, air travel and successful route development are a critical element that will enhance connectivity across the Eurasian region.

The agenda will include two key tracks: a daylong high-level economic summit followed by face-to-face meetings between airlines, airports, and tourism authorities.

Vladimir Yakushev, CEO of Northern Capital Gateway LLC, the operator of Pulkovo Airport, said:

 “We are pleased to host the first ‘Silk Sky’ together with GTI. With St. Petersburg’s advantageous geographic location and high potential as a hub between Europe and Asia, it is hard to imagine a better venue for an event of such kind. We invite the aviation and tourism professionals to join the forum for the unique market insights and new business opportunities and truly look forward to be welcoming the participants at Pulkovo St. Petersburg Airport soon.”

Yevgeny Pankevich, Chairman of the St. Petersburg Committee for Tourism Development, noted: 

“For Saint Petersburg, it is a great honor to become the first host city for the new ‘Silk Sky’ international aviation and tourism forum. The Northern capital of Russia is the world's leading cultural, tourism and business destination. I am confident that the event will become a perfect platform for creating new Eurasian transport links and will make a significant contribution to the development of the global “Belt and Road” initiative.”

Sallyanne Collins, the Managing Director for GTI events, revealed: 

“’Silk Sky’ 2019 will provide an exclusive networking opportunity for airlines, airports, major economic, tourism and trade organizations on the ‘Belt and Road’, to discuss new business opportunities. We are proud to work alongside Pulkovo International Airport to launch the inaugural Annual Aviation and Tourism Forum ‘Silk Sky’ in the incredible city of Saint Petersburg."

'Silk Sky' will be held on October 8-10, 2019, at the Belmond Grand Hotel Europe in the heart of Saint Petersburg, Russia. The 5* venue in one of the finest cities in the world, is looking forward to hosting this prestigious forum that will help to shape and strengthen the role that aviation plays in the 'Belt and Road' strategy over the coming decade, including the development of new air hubs.
