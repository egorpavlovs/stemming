Saint Petersburg booth became one of the most attended at the leading global event for the meetings and events industry IBTM World. The show finished its work on November 19 in Barcelona. Saint Petersburg was presented by Convention Bureau and MICE companies – Baltic Travel Company, Belmond Grand Hotel Europe, Diuim DMC Russia, ExpoForum, Global Russia DMC & PCO, Restec Events, Rusmice, Russian Empire DMC, Tsar Events DMC & PCO, UTS Group. Thus Convention Bureau fulfilled a function of a liaison between international event organizers and operators in Saint Petersburg.

“The composition of specialists and hosted buyers that visited Saint Petersburg booth was very diverse. These were Spain and Italy, Germany and Great Britain, Latin America, China. We held about 100 talks. Clients were interested in the organization of incentive tours to Saint Petersburg generally”, - head of sales of Convention Bureau Elena Yazeva told.

10 group presentations took place at Saint Petersburg booth during three IBTM World days. More than 100 MICE professionals became their listeners. Saint Petersburg is characterized by active business environment, high scientific potential, rich culture, modern convention and tourism infrastructure. All these points create a unique proposal for holding events. The main goal of the presentations was sharing this message with potential organizers of business and MICE events. The speech about the support program for event planners increased the interest in Saint Petersburg.

The themed reception in the honor of the Ice Hockey World Championship became the addition to the business part of the exhibition. Saint Petersburg will host the games of this grand sport event next year. Branded hockey pucks and hand-made knitted hose were gifted to visitors of Saint Petersburg booth on this occasion. Buyers from countries where the real winter never happens liked the souvenirs especially.

IBTM World in Barcelona closed the exhibition season 2015 and became the most active among all exhibitions that Convention Bureau attended this year. Optimistic results of the event and numerous requests from foreign operators allow to speak about large perspectives of the development of meeting industry in Saint Petersburg.
