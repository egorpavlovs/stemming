The Anniversary 25th International Film Festival "Message to Man" will be opened in Saint Petersburg at the Palace square today.

 The grand multimedia show will start at 6.30 p.m. Famous Russian actor Danila Kozlovskiy will sing jazz hits to the orchestral symphony accompaniment. After that visitors will see the premier of the Human, film by Yann Arthus-Bertrand. The movie is a collection of stories and images of our world, offering an immersion to the core of what it means to be human. Through these stories full of love and happiness, as well as hatred and violence, Human brings us face to face with the other, making us reflect on our lives. From stories of everyday experiences to accounts of the most unbelievable lives, these poignant encounters share a rare sincerity and underline who we are – our darker side, but also what is most noble in us, and what is universal.

Over 3,400 films from 83 countries entered the qualifying round of the International Film Festival "Message to Man". There are works from Bahrain and Qatar. This year 90 films from 45 countries were selected. The festival team prepared over 15 special programs, which will be demonstrated at 13 city venues. For the first time the audience of "Message to Man" will see the panorama of story film composed from cinematic winners of prestigious foreign festivals.

The International Film Festival "Message to Man" will last 8 days, until 3th October.
