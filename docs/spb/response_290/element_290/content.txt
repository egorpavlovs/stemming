                St. Petersburg won the bid to host the World Congress of The World Society of Cardio-Thoracic Surgeons 2020 from one of the strongest congress city  Dubai (UAE). According WSCTS President, Dr Vipin Zamvara (UK), St. Petersburg bid aroused great interest among the Congress delegates and the Board of WSCTS  Directors.

Andrei Mushkarev, the Chairman of Committee for Tourism Development of St. Petersburg, said "This victory is the result of the great work done by St. Petersburg convention Bureau for attraction leading international events in the city. It is expected that the upcoming WSCTS Congress 2020 will attract over a thousand cardiothoracic expert surgeons from 60 countries in St. Petersburg. It will improve the image of the city in the international arena, attract additional funds in the budget, as well as to confirm the status of St. Petersburg, as a leading destination in Europe".

  The World Congress of the World Society of Cardiothoracic Surgeons (WSCTS) has been held annually since 1991 as an international platform for the exchange of knowledge, experience and progressive ideas in clinical care and research of cardiothoracic medicine.

Host city for the next congress is chosen annually for 3 years prior to the event: the international reputation of professional community of the city and the applicant country is taken into consideration. In May 2016 St. Petersburg Convention Bureau made an application of the bid of Saint Petersburg to host the World Congress of the World Society of Cardiothoracic Surgeons (WSCTS). The bid of St. Petersburg was shortlisted; represented at the Congress on September, 11th. St. Petersburg won the voting from the nearest competitor - Dubai and will host the World Society of Cardiothoracic Surgeons 2020 ( WSCTS).
