              Overview

              Dating back to the reign of Henry VIII, this is amongst the world's finest palaces specifically built to entertain and impress. Today many of the palace's magnificent staterooms are offered as unique backdrops for prestigious events. Whether it be a grand banquet in the splendour of Henry VIII's Great Hall or a small dinner for a select few in the intimacy of William III's Banqueting House, Hampton Court Palace can provide the perfect setting for a range of formal events, in keeping with these royal surroundings. Don't forget the exquisite gardens too for something more relaxed.
