              Overview

              Located between the Houses of Parliament and Tate Britain, this modern, luxury hotel has been specially designed to offer business and leisure travellers more than just somewhere to sleep. The 460 bedrooms including 16 suites, many with wonderful views across London and the River Thames, are complimented by modern public spaces (including a 14th floor sky business lounge). Each hotel room is designed not only to be a bedroom, but a fresh, bright and air-conditioned living space where guests can work or simply wind down and relax. Natural light pours in to each room from full-height, opening and sound proofed double-glazed windows.
