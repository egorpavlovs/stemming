A selection of new meeting venues in London
Science Gallery LondonThe Science Gallery London aims to connect art, science and health, bringing together researchers, artists, students and the local community. Set over three floors, the venue features several cafes, courtyards, a terrace and a theatre, making it fit for a variety of events. The venue can accommodate up to 750 delegates and offers in-house catering.
The new Royal Academy of ArtsDesigned by acclaimed architect Sir David Chipperfield, the new two-acre site links the Grade II-listed Burlington House with Burlington Gardens for the first time. Key features of the new site include a double-height lecture theatre with more than 260 seats, a new learning centre and of course, the bridge connecting the House and Gardens.
Queen Elizabeth Hall and Purcell Room - Southbank CentreThe restoration of the building has focused on both auditoria, the foyer and back of house facilities. Restored wood and brushed concrete contribute to the brutalist aesthetic, while in the foyer, newly installed glass panelling bathes the spacious area with natural light and showcases stunning river views. The space can hold up to 900 delegates.
PublicPublic is the latest venture by Street Feast, the company behind several of London’s street food markets. Boasting some of London’s best street food traders, five pubs and bars, two mezzanine levels and a 14,500 sq ft ground floor area, Public is a versatile event space suitable for work functions, screenings, conferences and parties of up to 1,000 guests.
The Theatre, Alexandra PalaceAfter being closed for 80 years, The Theatre at Alexandra Palace has reopened following a £26.7m restoration project. The Theatre offers several packages for event planners, including conference daily delegate rates, banqueting packages and team building rates, and can accommodate up to 1,300 delegates.
Tottenham Hotspur StadiumDiscover the new stadium for one of the most famous football teams in the world. With more than 62,000 seats, it is a grand addition to London’s stadia and has plenty to offer to event planners. Fit for small and large-scale events with a capacity of up to 1,500, you’re sure to impress your delegates with an event overlooking the pitch.
Illuminate at The Science MuseumHost your event in one of London’s most famous museums with Illuminate. Located on levels 4 and 5 of the Science Museum, the space is available for both day and evening hire, with stunning views, and a capacity of up to 450. The Science Museum will provide planners with bespoke packages thanks to its collaboration with catering and AV partners.
Fotografiska LondonImmerse your delegates in the world of photography with Fotografiska London, due to open in spring 2019. This London Whitechapel expansion of the Swedish brand aims to educate visitors about photography, both established and up-and-coming. The new London museum will feature a food offering, educational facilities, art-oriented shops and event spaces.
Focus on… King’s Cross for events
King’s Cross is one of the largest and most successful regeneration projects in London. This new cultural hub for the capital also makes an exciting setting for events, festivals and performances. The neighbourhood offers a range of inspiring spaces capable of hosting events of all sizes and, thanks to its numerous transport links, including international rail, is very easily accessible.
Battle Bridge Place One of the highest footfall areas on the site, Battle Bridge Place is an ideal space for small events, pop-up installations and experiential activities. The open nature of this space provides great flexibility, and guests can enjoy the stunning backdrop of the multi-award-winning buildings of King’s Cross and St Pancras stations.
Canalside Steps These south-facing steps sweep down to Regent’s Canal from Granary Square. A natural theatre, this space is ideal for outdoor arts, music recitals and cinema screenings, with space for approximately 200 people. It’s also an ideal stop-off point for canal boats, bringing a unique opportunity to incorporate the canal network into your event.
West Handyside Canopy This unusual outdoor covered space is ideal for all sorts of events, from destination attractions and art installations, to corporate events, brand showcases and more. Its location makes the perfect extension to large-scale events on Granary Square. With a capacity of 1,000, it is one of the largest spaces on the site and one of the most versatile.
The Crossing An open-plan space spanning Central Saint Martins and the Granary Building, this space is a striking backdrop for fashion shows, award ceremonies, exhibitions and art installations. Glass walls at both ends flood The Crossing in natural daylight.
