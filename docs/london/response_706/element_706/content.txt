London & Partners helped Nigeria create a showcase during the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.
The Bank of Industry (BOI) is Nigeria’s oldest Development Finance Institution. Its role is to transform the country's economy and integrate it into the global marketplace.
In pursuit of this mandate, the BOI partnered with the Nigerian National Olympic Committee to showcase the country's rich cultural heritage and economic potential in the UK capital during London 2012.
The Games of the 30th Olympiad presented a unique opportunity to link Nigerian businesses to those from other countries and introduce Nigeria to the international community as an ideal destination for investment.
During the London 2012 Games, Nigeria took over the Theatre Royal Stratford East. The 465-seat auditorium was the main arena for the Nigerian National Olympic Committee's celebrations and concerts organised by the British Council.
The area around the theatre in the Olympic borough of Newham is known as the Cultural Quarter. It was used to promote the country's film and visual arts industry with a series of screenings and pop-up events. A theatre project assisted 30 artists of Nigerian descent to develop a new piece of work through an award of £3,000 each, sponsored by BOI.
Nigeria also staged a high-level investment and business summit within the grand surroundings of the Dorchester Hotel on Park Lane. The three-day Forum featured presentations by key Federal Government Officials, State Governors, Nigerian businesses and international development partners.
The Surrey Chamber of Commerce also conducted a series of business and cultural exchanges with the BOI to develop relationships between Nigerian companies and those based in the county.
How London & Partners helped
The London Organising Committee (LOCOG) referred the Nigerian National Olympic Committee and the BOI to London & Partners in March 2011 to explore the options for a Hospitality House.
The Theatre Royal Stratford East, Stratford Old Town Hall and the British Library were identified as potential venues. Following an informative site visit to the Theatre Royal by members of BOI’s management team, accompanied by London & Partners’ Event Solutions Manager, Fiona Plumpton, an agreement was reached.
“London & Partners also played a key role in lobbying for the Ballroom at the Dorchester Hotel in the midst of very tight availability of function suites during London 2012,” says Tokunbo Chiedu, Chief Executive of Compass Consulting, who worked alongside the BOI team as Project Consultants. “Nigeria went on to hold a very successful three-day business event, promoting trade and investment to around 1,000 invited guests.”
London & Partners also helped BOI capitalise on London's strengths as a hub for creative industries. As part of BOI's longer-term plans to develop Nigeria’s creative industries, the bank wanted to connect with UK academic institutions specialising in this area. London & Partners arranged for the BOI management team to visit cutting-edge digital college Ravensbourne and the University of East London during their stay in the capital.
London & Partners also referred the BOI to The School of Oriental and African Studies, which resulted in strengthened ties between the two organisations.
