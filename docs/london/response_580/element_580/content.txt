                Introduction
                
                  Little’s has developed a specialist conference transport management service that fits seamlessly into your event plan.

              Overview

              Whether you require multiple individual delegate chauffeur transfers, or group transportation for evening social programmes, Little’s can manage all the ground transportation for your event.
                  We are diligent planners with a wealth of experience, and we ensure that every aspect of transport is considered and managed. For example, our systems show extensive detail for each individual journey, but they also allow us to group together delegates who are arriving on the same flight, helping to improve efficiency and reduce your costs.
                  Our aim is to completely remove the stress when you book, and to deliver exceptional service on the day. That means double checking your itinerary and planning for every contingency. All this is backed up by excellent customer service – and a pledge to always return your enquiry with a personalised response. Or to put it another way, we remove the pain from transport management.
