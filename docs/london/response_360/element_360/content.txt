              Overview

              The Globe is a truly unique venue situated on London's cultural Bankside. It features some marvellous spaces for exclusive private events. 
                  Whether for meetings, receptions, launches or presentations, the rooms are particularly striking areas for private hire, because they directly reflect the character and purpose of the Globe itself.
