              Overview

              Now in its ninth decade, Bentley’s first opened its doors in 1916 in the same beautiful old Victorian building it occupies today. Chef Richard Corrigan restored the original Bentley’s to its former glory in 2005 to critical acclaim.
                  Bentley’s has two beautiful private dining rooms. The Crustacea Room seats up to 14 and the Jameson Room up to 60 (100 for a drinks reception). Neither room has a room hire charge or minimum spend requirement.
