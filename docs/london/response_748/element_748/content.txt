              Overview

              Centrally located conference facilities in a unique setting overlooking the river Thames, adjacent to London Bridge and at the heart of the capital’s thriving Bankside. 
                  Our premier room, the Garry Weston Library, provides a flexible space for fine dining, canapé receptions, lectures and for other bespoke events. Other rooms are ideally suited for away day training and seminars.
                  On-site caterers provide all your catering needs, offering a range of bespoke packages to enhance your event.
                  For that extra unique event, our Millennium Courtyard provides an outdoor space for private receptions and marquee hire can also be accommodated.
