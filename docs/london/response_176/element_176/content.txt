London Gatwick (LGW)
Just under 30 miles from central London, Gatwick serves 35 million customers annually and is another popular airport considered when reviewing your corporate travel management. There are four airport lounges available for business or leisure customers to enjoy. A further Regus Express lounge is exclusively available for business travellers. Once inside, guests can use the lounge facilities to freshen up, squeeze in a meeting in one of 11 conference rooms or catch up on work in a private workpod. Getting into central London is a 30-minute journey on the Gatwick Express.
London Stansted (STN)
At 30 miles north east of London, Stansted is one of Europe’s fastest-growing airports and can be an ideal airport for those looking to travel and conduct their business in London. It features a business lounge within the terminal and meeting and conference facilities a short walk away at the Radisson Blu Edwardian Stansted Hotel. The Stansted Express is the quickest way to transport delegates into central London. Trains run every 15 minutes and take 47 minutes.
London City (LCY)
Only six miles from central London and three miles from Canary Wharf, City airport is one of the most accessible for business travel to London. The Docklands Light Railway is the fastest public transport route into the heart of the city with trains departing every eight to 15 minutes. Within the airport itself a first class and business lounge are available offering quiet spaces to work.
London Luton (LTN)
Around 25 miles north of central London, this growing international airport is planning to increase its capacity to 18 million passengers by 2020. Lounge facilities include quiet areas to work and Snooze pods to relax and recharge. Trains leave Luton Airport Parkway every 10 minutes to Blackfriars, City Thameslink, Farringdon and St Pancras International with an average travel time of 40 minutes.

Eurostar
For many business travellers coming from Europe, the Eurostar represents a fast, efficient and often cheap travel alternative to flying when organising your corporate business travel. Get from Germany by connecting at Brussels. Journeys from Paris and Brussels take just over two hours to reach the heart of London. From Amsterdam it takes only four hours to arrive at St Pancras International. Travel business class to benefit from 10-minute check-in, a three-course meal and lounge access in London, Paris and Brussels stations. Group travel can be made extra special by hiring a whole carriage. An incentive trip could even have its own branding for the occasion!
