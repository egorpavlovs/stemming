Few places on Earth can lay claim to such a diverse range of settings, backed by some of the most creative experiential practitioners.
Event surveyed its agency readers, asking them to submit the total level of brand experience budgets spend that was delivered in the UK between 1 June 2016 and May 2017. From this, each agency extrapolated the budget spend for London alone. The figures were combined and the results have been published in a white paper, 'London's Experiential Playground'.  
Read the report to learn more about the experiential events landscape in London, the motivation behind London as the destination of choice for experiential campaigns, and innovative activations that brands are bringing to the capital.
