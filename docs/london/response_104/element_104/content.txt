              Overview

              One of the world's finest luxury hotels, Cliveden is a grand stately home surrounded by 376 acres of magnificent formal gardens and parkland. 
                  Cliveden’s dramatic history includes philandering Dukes, America’s ‘richest citizen’, house parties for prime ministers and visits by Queen Victoria. Cliveden has played host to every British monarch since George I and has been home to three dukes, an earl and Frederick Prince of Wales. 
                  Each of the hotel’s 49 bedrooms is dramatically decorated in lavish period style. The hotel’s various lounges, private rooms and meeting spaces offer flexibility for groups from four to 120.
