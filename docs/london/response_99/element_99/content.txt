              Overview

              Built in 1756-66 for the first Earl Spencer, an ancestor of Diana, Princess of Wales, Spencer House is London’s finest surviving 18th-century private palace. Each client has exclusive use of the House, whatever the size or scale of the occasion. The eight state rooms provide an elegant backdrop for civil wedding ceremonies, wedding receptions, musical evenings, lectures and press presentations.  
                  Receptions can be held for up to 450 guests, 500 if using the Terrace, while seated lunches and dinners can be accommodated for any number from 2-120. Theatre-style meetings can also be held, for a maximum of 100 guests.
