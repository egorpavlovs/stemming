              Overview

              Just north of Regent’s Park, the 4 star London Marriott Hotel Regents Park is ideally located with easy access to London’s major motorways and benefits from a large on-site car park outside of the congestion charging zone. Swiss Cottage Underground station on the Jubilee line is a short walk away and provides direct access to Wembley, Baker Street, Westminster, North Greenwich for The O2 and Canning Town for ExCel. 
                  The meeting & event space is made up of 8 meeting rooms. At over 310 square metres in size and almost 4 metres in height, the Adelaide Suite is the largest room and a highly versatile space, the perfect setting to create a unique event: from conferences and exhibitions, to award ceremonies and social events. The suite benefits from its own private foyer and entrance, and is supported by the Park Room which can be used as a break-out room or event office.
                  The hotel also comprises 304 spacious bedrooms, including over 150 rooms with two double beds. The on-site Leisure Club features an indoor swimming pool, gym, sauna and steam room. Additional services include the Indian restaurant Zaike NW3, Chats bar, 24-hour room service and the Executive Lounge.
