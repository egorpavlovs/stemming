              Overview

              The Trafalgar is an irresistibly charming boutique hotel right in the heart of London.   An astoundingly chic hotel with minimalist style and décor, close to famous attractions such as the Houses of Parliament, Big Ben, Westminster Abbey and the London Eye, the jewel in its crown is the roof garden where you’ll stand eye-to-eye with Admiral Nelson. Located in Trafalgar Square, the heart of the West End, the trafalgar benefits from excellent underground and rail connections to take you across London and beyond. 
                   Events and occasions: Meeting facilities here specialize in being different to anything else you’ll find. The Boardroom has superb views over Trafalgar Square and is fitted with original 1930’s wood paneling; it has a warm atmosphere suitable for meetings, presentations, lunches, drinks, parties and dinners. Located adjacent to the Boardroom, The Strategy Room’s dramatic floor-to-ceiling windows offer similarly inspiring views. Both rooms are connected by a small foyer and can be used together for larger events. The roof garden is also available for private hire – a unique venue for up to 70 people, it’s ideal for a welcome reception. 
                   Available for private events, the trafalgar’s award-winning Rockwell Bar is London's first bourbon bar, with over 100 bourbons on the menu. The gym is equipped with the latest performance equipment – perfect for working off tension after a busy day.  Delegates can kick back in 129 large bedrooms, or work out in the gym.
