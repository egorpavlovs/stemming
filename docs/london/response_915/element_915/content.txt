              Overview

              Located in London's Chelsea, the National Army Museum explores the army's character and impact from the British Civil War right up to the modern day.
                  A range of spaces are available to hire for events. Highlights include the Atrium at the heart of the museum flooded by natural light from a glass ceiling, and the boardroom with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the Royal Hospital gardens, which is the home of the RHS Chelsea Flower Show.
