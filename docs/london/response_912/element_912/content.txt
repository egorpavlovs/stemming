              Overview

              One of the 12 Great Livery Companies of the City of London, it was founded to regulate the craft or trade of the goldsmith, and, since 1300, has been responsible for testing precious metals. Today the Company operates the Goldsmiths' Company Assay Office, which offers a range of hallmarking services and continues to apply the king's mark of the leopard’s head. It also funds charities and educational initiatives, as well as supporting and promoting jewellery and silversmithing through numerous initiatives.
                  The Company is based at Goldsmiths’ Hall, a magnificent building designed by Philip Hardwick, who went on to design many other important buildings around London. (Massive Corinthian columns support the façade, while gilded mouldings and coats of arms adorn the walls and ceilings of the interior.) Now designated a Grade 1 Listed Building, Goldsmiths’ Hall stands as a monument to the gracious and imposing nature of 19th century design. Exhibitions and events are regularly held at Goldsmiths' Hall throughout the year enabling members of the public to visit this architectural treasure.  
                  Goldsmiths' Hall is available for meetings, conferences, concerts, dinners and other functions.
