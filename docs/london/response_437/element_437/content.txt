              Overview

              Surrounded by independent stores, cafes and restaurants, the hotel's stylish decor is perfectly in keeping with the village feel of its home in Seven Dials.
                  A mix of classic and contemporary artwork brings to life the area's incredible cultural heritage from the first moment guests walk through the doors. The hotel is located close to London's iconic Theatreland, Covent Garden's famous Piazza and the cafes, bars and shops of Bond Street, Oxford Street and Soho.
                  The hotel's four meeting rooms feature cutting-edge technology and catering for anything from two to 60 guests. Mercer Street's 137 rooms and suites offer the perfect combination of modern comfort and a welcoming, boutique feel.
                  Luxurious 350-thread-count Egyptian cotton bedding, down pillows and stylish bathrooms are joined by complimentary Mac minis and individual touches like Union Jack-designed Smeg fridges and theatre-style make up mirrors. A 24-hour fitness room is also available to all guests, as well as free high-speed wifi up to 150mbps on unlimited devices.
                  Monmouth Kitchen is a place to enjoy superb food, wine and cocktails in effortlessly cool surroundings. Exposed brickwork, contemporary furnishings and drop lighting provide the backdrop to an exquisite menu of Peruvian and Italian sharing plates.
                  Everything is made fresh onsite, right down to the dried fruit used in the bar's superb selection of cocktails.
