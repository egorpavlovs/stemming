EAACI, the European Academy of Allergy & Clinical Immunology chose London to host its 29th Annual Congress because of its vibrant culture and excellent event facilities.
With almost 6,100 individual members and 40 European National Societies, EAACI is the primary source of expertise in Europe for all aspects of allergy.
London was deemed the ideal destination for the 29th EAACI Annual Congress in 2010. The capital's International Convention Centre, ExCel London, provided the large, flexible space required to accommodate the main congress, plenary sessions, exhibition and registration for the biggest Allergy Congress in the world to date.
Many of the 8,000 international delegates were also able to take advantage of the ICC's proximity to London City Airport. Located five minutes from ExCeL, this international airport offers 350 flights a day and connects London to more than 30 key destinations and cities across Europe.
How London & Partners Helped
 
"The EAACI 2010 Congress was a great success, with over 8,000 delegates attending. In fact, it turned out to be the biggest Allergy Congress in the world to date. The Congress attracted many journalists from around the world, which generated a lot of international news coverage." Jenny Strömgård, Account Manager, Congrex Sweden AB
London & Partners helped the event organisers make the most of London's assets, in terms of the hugely successful venue and the city's wide range of quality hotels and venues for social events
During their stay in the UK capital, delegates were also encouraged to explore the city, and London & Partners provided city guides highlighting events and places to go in the UK capital. In addition, full day tours exploring areas outside of London were made available for those delegates who stayed an extra day.
