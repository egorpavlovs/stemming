              Overview

              London’s favourite Royal Park is on your doorstep, yet, just a mile away and you're in the non-stop excitement and phenomenal buzz of one of the world’s genuine entertainment ‘hot-spots’, London’s West End. Harrods is just a 15-minute walk away in fashionable Knightsbridge and the Royal Albert Hall – home to the Summer Proms – is also nearby. Browse the stalls at Portobello Market or wander the streets of Notting Hill – all within close proximity. 
                  Events & Occasions: The Park Suite (125sq m/1,351sq ft) takes up to 100 guests and is ideal for high class events where privacy is important.  Situated on the lower ground floor, it has a private entrance and foyer area. Great crystal chandeliers add a touch of luxury. The Park Suite is a multi-purpose conference and banqueting venue. Two other stylish suites are available for smaller events. 
                  The wealth of period detail in the Library Lounge provides an elegant, yet cozy bar area with an inviting fireplace and a stained glass skylight; it’s ideal for informal business meetings and relaxed evenings. The concierge can arrange sight seeing excursions and even horse riding in Hyde Park. You’ll find an underground station right next to the hotel, offering easy access across London.
