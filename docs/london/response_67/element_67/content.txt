London is ranked one of the world’s top cities for international congresses. It is also recognised for business innovation and academic excellence across a number of sectors including life sciences, finance, technology and the creative industries.
The London Ambassador Programme, created by London & Partners, invites experts from a range of sectors in recognition of the vital role they play in promoting the great city of London on the global stage.
London Ambassadors come from a variety of professional backgrounds, with a broad range of expertise, for example university professors, senior company executives and prominent thought-leaders.
Through this exclusive programme you will gain access to a network of senior professionals and academics, sharing expertise and celebrating success, while helping us raise London’s profile internationally and generate economic benefit through influencing and encouraging European and international associations to hold congresses in London.

Sharing successes in your industry that can help us shape how we promote London as a city of innovation and expertise
Facilitating with introductions and letters of support

Providing sector knowledge content to strengthen bids for congresses and events
