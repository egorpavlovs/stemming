          CREDAI NATCON 2017 "Revive, Reinvent and Refocus" held in London
          
		The Confederation of Real Estate Developers' Associations of India (CREDAI) held the 2017 National Convention (NATCON) in London. The three-day event evolved the theme 'revive, reinvent and refocus' with eyes on the greater goal of building the cities that will be the pride of India.

Background
The theme for this year was ‘Revive, Reinvent and Refocus’. The real estate industry is constantly reinventing itself to adapt to the ever-changing needs of buyers. In India in particular the Confederation strives to bring people the finest residential spaces and properties and has the noble ambition of building futuristic cities that will be the pride of the country.
The Experience
From 10th -12th August 2017 the hotel Park Plaza Westminster Bridge welcomed 820 delegates to the three-day event. As the main conference venue, Park Plaza Westminster was the most suitable venue, tailored to NATCON's conference needs. Plan it! by Creative Travel was appointed by CREDAI to facilitate the delegates for their travel requirements to attend CREDAI NATCON. Plan it! worked closely with a selection of suppliers, including London DMC for staffing and transportation services, AVC live for audio and visual support. Perton Signs supplied all the brandings, while Ardan Exhibitions managed the exhibition stalls.
NATCON 2017 bought together renowned government officials, game-changing entrepreneurs, top property consultants, policy makers and digital experts. The conference featured engrossing panel discussions and presentations that illuminate the future of Indian real estate. CREDAI also released a report "Indian Real Estate in 2017 and Beyond" in association with its knowledge partner CBRE. NATCON 2017 served as a powerful platform to strengthen the relationship between the Indian and global real estate markets.
A Great Success

“The event was a great success and we would definitely like to work with Park Plaza again. Delegates were happy with the content of the conference and the hospitality of the venue. It did reach the right people.”

Ragini Wanchoo, Project Manager at Plan it! Meetings & Conferences
Why London
CREDAI believes that India and London have strong ties in both business and personal relationships. London is both welcoming and home to a great deal of architectural heritage and up-to-the-minute developments; a destination which offers a lot of inspiration for any real estate developers. In fact, a study tour was organised for the developers which encompassed several beautiful architectural highlights: King’s Cross, The Shard, Battersea Power Station and Canary Wharf.

London & Partners’ Role
London & Partners was there to help from the initial stages with Visit Britain in collaboration; one team to assist the event planners. Not only did London & Partners support the event and share their contacts in the city, but they also provided expertise on venue selection for the main conference and the gala dinner, and helped to secure the Deputy Mayor of London for business, Rajesh Agrawal to attend the inaugural of the conference. Mr. Agrawal shared with the attendees London's strengths and the London Plan, which includes strategies for housing, transport, economic development, and the environment. He also introduced Home for Londoners, a new plan focused on delivering and supporting new models of housing.
About CREDAI and NATCON
