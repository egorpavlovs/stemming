Stay at the Royal Garden Hotel with views of Hyde Park or at the brand new Intercontinental at The O2 overlooking the River Thames.
If you’re looking for a conference room with a view, then London has plenty to offer. Try the River Rooms at the Mermaid which provide stunning views over the Thames, or the Lancaster London near Kensington Gardens.
Tower above the city at dinner time at Galvin at Windows, located at the top of the London Hilton on Park Lane, or try the subtropical Sky Garden at 20 Fenchurch, otherwise known as the ‘Walkie-Talkie’. Alternatively, the Gherkin and the Shard offer more intimate private dining options.
The Hilton London Metropole, Europe’s largest hotel, opened a brand new restaurant in January 2016 offering views over the city skyline. It accommodates up to 200 people for private events.
Last but not least, soar to the highest heights with London Helicopter, which take groups of eight from their Battersea landing pad, or learn how to play roulette on the rooftop at the Hippodrome Casino. And if that’s not enough to whet your appetite, take a trip on the Emirates Airline cable car to see all of London in its glory.
Our expert convention bureau team can help you and your clients experience the best of what London has to offer, whatever you are looking for. Contact us to find out more.
