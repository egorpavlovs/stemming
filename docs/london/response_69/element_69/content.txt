Companies travelling to London on business may be entitled to reclaim VAT on certain business expenses, goods and services.
UK VAT regulations mean that associations, corporate event organisers and business travellers could be entitled to a tax refund and reclaim 20% tax on the following expenses:

Accommodation
Venue hire
Business entertaining
Food and beverage
Event costs
Transport
Promotional marketing/advertising

The UK is one of a limited number of EU countries who allow non-EU claimants to reclaim VAT.
How to reclaim VAT in London
We have partnered with Blick Rothenberg LLP, accounting services specialists, who can advise on whether you are entitled to reclaim VAT (after the initial consultation, a fee may apply).
