              Overview

              AC Travel Group was established in the UK in 1990 and its DMC operation in 1994.
                   We cover UK, Ireland and Channel Islands, budget to luxury and ad hoc tours.
                   We offer inspirational tailor made solutions for MICE, incentives and corporate groups, covering a wide spectrum of services.
                   Apart from areas such as London, Edinburgh, Liverpool/Manchester and Dublin/Belfast, we are increasingly working with excellent country style estates outside the main cities, especially well suited for incentives, conferences etc.
                   Our MD/Owner has held leading positions within the industry in London since 1982 and is still involved in our day to day business.
                   A DMC with traditional values, but also with the vision to embrace change, create and deliver new concepts and products. We take a long term view with our partners and our vast experience, integrity and dedication to service remain the cornerstones of continued success.
