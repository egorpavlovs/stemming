As part of the Mayor of London’s promotional organisation, our team of association experts can help you access the widest range of venues, hotels and support services available in London. There is no charge for our services.
The city that speaks 300 languages offers some 19,000 restaurants, more than 65 with Michelin stars; 140,000 hotel rooms ranging from budget to five star; more than 1,000 remarkable venues including historic ships and futuristic towers; 173 museums and over 850 galleries.
The city is constantly evolving. Billions of pounds have poured into London, creating even faster and greener transport links, a greater range of accommodation, and regeneration hotspots with new attractions and venues.

An award-winning destination

Best International MICE destination in Today's Traveller Awards 2013

"London has transformed itself as a congress destination over the last four years, both in terms of world-class facilities and new infrastructure."
Grégoire Pavillon, Executive Director of EASL
