                  The Symphony
                  With only a wall of glass between you and the stunning London scenery, being onboard the Symphony not only shows you the spectacular views but allows you feel part of them! Guests are left with the feeling that they have experienced all that London can offer.
                  The Naticia
                  With a glass roof that can be retracted, the Naticia allows guests to dance under the stars whilst cruising past the picturesque sights of London.
