              Overview

              Located in Blackfriars, The Mermaid London is a unique and flexible venue, with several meeting rooms with a capacity for 12 to 600 people, exhibition space and two function rooms with fantastic river views. 
                  At the heart of The Mermaid London is the main Auditorium with tiered seating for 600 delegates, making it the largest seated auditorium in central London. The recently refurbishment Newgate boasts an excellent exhibition space, that holds up to 40 stands (three metres by two metres) in a shell scheme format. It can also be broken down into four smaller meeting rooms for 14 to 330 delegates and up to 400 people for dinner. 
                  There are another two meeting rooms which hold 50 to 150 people on the second floor. The rooms can be used in conjunction with the Auditorium or stand alone. 
                  The River Rooms have their own entrance and have fabulous views of The Shard, Shakespeare’s Globe and Tate Modern. The Lower River Room holds up to 200 for a reception and 180 for a seated dinner. The recently refurbished Upper River Room can hold up to 500 for a reception and 320 for dinner. The Upper River Room has undergone construction to raise ceilings, remove pillars, relocate bars and add new flooring, to further boost the experience of guests.
