		London & Partners worked with AV Business & Communication and Brook Green UK to deliver a once-in-a-lifetime incentive trip to London for Argentine confectionery company Arcor during the 2012 London Olympic and Paralympic Games.
The top distributors of Argentine confectionery company Arcor were treated to a once-in-a-lifetime seven-night incentive trip to the Olympic host city in August 2012.  
The trip, for 44 of Arcor’s top sales people, was organised by Argentine agency AV Business & Communication, in partnership with London & Partners, and leading destination management company Brook Green UK, who handled the activities on the ground.
The distributors stayed at the four-star Hilton London Metropole, one of Europe’s largest hotel and conference centres, ideally located close to one of the two Westfield shopping centres found in the capital, as well as the theatres and attractions of London’s West End.
The aim of the incentive programme was to reward Arcor’s top performing sales people by involving them in London’s summer of Olympic sport. The memories created by experiencing London’s unique cityscape during this historical period would motivate the distributors for many years to come.
On the first day, the group headed to Wembley Stadium to cheer on the sides competing in the men’s Olympic football semifinals. They then dined in one of the traditional English gastropubs located close to the hotel.
The next day, the group were given 12 private capsules on the EDF Energy London Eye, the tallest observation wheel in Europe. After enjoying the spectacular views along the River Thames, the group was whisked off to the North Greenwich Arena (The O2) to watch the quarterfinals of the men’s basketball.
After two days of Olympic action, the third day was a chance for the group to spend the morning visiting iconic London landmarks such as St Paul’s Cathedral and the Tower of London, home to the Crown Jewels.In the afternoon, the group shopped at leisure around the world famous stores of Oxford Street, Regent Street and New Bond Street.
On day four, the group visited the Queen’s royal residency, Windsor Castle before being transferred back to the North Greenwich Arena for the men’s basketball semifinals.
The next afternoon, the group headed for the Olympic Park to soak up the atmosphere and witness an evening of exciting athletics and the roar of the Olympic Stadium.
The group’s final day in the capital began with a stadium tour of Chelsea Football Club, followed by more exciting sporting action at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.
The final evening was spent on board the Edwardian, one of a number of Thames Luxury Charter vessels for a dinner cruise along the London’s famous river.
Results
Alejandro Verzoub, President of AV Business & Communication says: “London & Partners managed this trip brilliantly in a crowded Olympic period. Our hotel and its service were very professional and its location was ideal for travelling to and from the Olympic venues.
“The most memorable part of the programme was our last day watching the Olympic action and the farewell dinner onboard the Edwardian. As we cruised along the Thames, all the iconic buildings were lit up, which proved a wonderful sight.
“We always recommend London to our clients because it is a truly magnificent city with a lot of cultural, entertaining and unique activities on offer to incentive groups.
“We are always confident of working in London as London & Partners have helped us in the past to bring south American clients to the UK capital before major European meetings shows such as EIBTM. They have always helped us to secure important relationships with venues and hoteliers and vital information whenever it has been required so choosing London as an incentive destination is easy for us.
“I would highly recommend the professional services of Chris Lynn and his team in the US, as well as Barbara Jamison and the rest of the London & Partners team in the UK.”
