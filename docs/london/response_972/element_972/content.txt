              Overview

              Kew Gardens, a World Heritage Site, has a variety of stunning, unique and awe-inspiring venues. 
                  Cambridge Cottage is an elegant former royal residence, set within its own private gardens, with two large function rooms. The magnificent Orangery is ideal for large evening receptions, with the adjoining conference room providing a modern daytime facility for meetings. In the Princess of Wales Conservatory your guests can wine, dine and dance the night away among tropical plants from around the globe.
                  Whatever venue you choose, you'll be helping us to continue our valuable plant conservation and life-saving research work.
