              Overview

              The Museum is one of the finest former private residences in London and first opened its doors as a National Museum in 1900. Home to unsurpassed displays of French 18th-century painting, furniture and porcelain, as well as iconic Old Master paintings and a world class armoury, Hertford House has been a spectacular venue for entertaining for over 100 years.
                  The grand surroundings of the 25 galleries and the contrasting contemporary glazed Courtyard make the Wallace Collection the perfect setting for corporate entertaining, product launches, fashion shows and private celebrations.
