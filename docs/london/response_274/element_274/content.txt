Your guests can lay their heads in London’s oldest and most elegant locations, such as Brown’s, a Rocco Forte Hotel in Mayfair, or at The Savoy which stands gracefully on the River Thames. If you prefer to be in the heart of Piccadilly then Hotel Café Royal is for you.
London’s most iconic venues are available to hire for events of all types. Alexandra Palace, the birth place of television, has a capacity of up to 7,000 for a reception, or host your dinner in front of Van Gogh’s Sunflowers at the world renowned National Gallery. Trinity House, otherwise disguised as the General Lighthouse Authority, has a mixture of grand and traditional spaces.
Once your conference is over, dine in style at the Natural History Museum or the Victoria and Albert Museum in Kensington, both of which provide stunning settings. The Crypt at St Paul’s Cathedral or Middle Temple, are equally worthy of a visit for a private dinner. Rules, London’s oldest restaurant, based in Covent Garden is ideal for smaller parties.
Round off your experience by recording a song at Abbey Road Studios, home of the Beatles fame or take a seat at the Chef’s Table at The Hyatt Regency London – Churchill, where you will be wowed by the chef’s creativity.
Our expert convention bureau team can help you and your clients experience the best of what London has to offer, whatever you are looking for. Contact us to find out more.
