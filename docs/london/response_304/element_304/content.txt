No other city on the planet matches London for energy, diversity, creativity and constant reinvention.
London offers venues to suit every budget, size, sector and taste. It's also home to some of the world's brightest minds, making it easier to book leading speakers, offer quality content and attract more delegates.
With this combination, it's no wonder that London is rated the top destination for return on objective for event planners compared to similar events held elsewhere.
Value for money
London is at the heart of Europe's low-cost airline network, and with a range of budget hotels, free world-class attractions and group discounts, you can save money on your London event without compromising on quality.
London is also home to global financial, media, advertising and ICT hubs and the largest cluster of European company headquarters, making it the best city in Europe to build business networks and meet future partners.
Beyond the main event, your delegates can revel in London's unique culture: London offers some of the most exciting and diverse attractions in the world, helping organisers offer rich and unique itineraries to delegates, from West End shows to royal palaces. And many of our museums are free to enter, including three of the world's top five.
