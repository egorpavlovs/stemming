Whether you are seeking a business hotel to host your corporate event or stay at, London Convention Bureau can help you find the right venue. London & Partners has worked with seven major hotel groups, representing around a third of the overall bedrooms available in London, to streamline the process for securing blocks of accommodation across the city.
The resulting London Accommodation Charter aims to standardise various booking terms and conditions, including allocation release times, commission rates and cancellation policy, for any bids in excess of 1,000 rooms (peak night volume).
The charter supports London to secure more congresses to London, helps business hotels in the sector work more smartly within the sector and acts as a support and intermediary between the association client, hotels and PCO's.
The hotel group signatories include Accor hotels, Radisson Blu Edwardian London, Millennium & Copthorne and Hilton, and represent more than a third of all hotel bedrooms in the capital.
Other hotel groups signed up to the charter are InterContinental Hotels Group, Park Plaza hotels, and Starwood.
In 2017 we will be reviewing the Charter for the first time, in collaboration with our partners. This update will reflect the changing landscape and booking behaviours of our association delegates. An updated version of the charter will be posted in the next few months so watch this space.
Terms of the charter
The charter includes the following terms:

Standard allocation release times
Standard commission rates
Standard policy for no shows and cancellations
Standard check-in/out times

The charter is an on-going document, and all hotel groups are encouraged to sign up.
It is to be noted that contracting and further negotiations surrounding legal terms and conditions will need to be conducted between the hotel and client/PCO/agent directly. London & Partners can support you with this process, contact our dedicated team. See our guidelines for full terms.
