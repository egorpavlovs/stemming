              Overview

              Events & Hospitality QM is the in-house venue and hospitality brand of Queen Mary University of London, offering venues for hire in three ideal locations: the City of London, Mile End, and Whitechapel.
                  From contemporary, purpose-built facilities such as the 400-capacity lecture theatre in the popular Blizard building, to historic venues such as the Grade II listed Great Hall in the People’s Palace and the Octagon in the Queens’ Building, we offer over 100 venues to suit any conference, launch, dinner, reception, or networking event.
                  In addition to our meeting facilities, we have over 1,000 ensuite bedrooms on campus available during the summer months and a dedicated catering service.
