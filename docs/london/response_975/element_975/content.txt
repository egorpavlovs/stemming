              Overview

              As one of London’s most architecturally rich venues, this Grade II* listed building encompasses diverse entertaining spaces, from classical and formal to contemporary galleries, in the presence of art works from 1500 to the present day. Venues include the Victorian Gallery 9, soaring Sackler Octagon and dramatic Manton Foyer.
                  Accommodating both day and evening events, the original Tate Gallery lends itself to all manner of corporate entertaining.
