              Overview

              The City Centre and Roman Amphitheatre provides a venue with a difference for receptions, dinners, seminars and meetings for 10 to 200 people. The space is available for hire throughout the day and evening.*
                  The City Model, an interactive bird's eye view of the present-day Square Mile, sits next to the ancient Roman Amphitheatre, dating from around AD50, and Undercroft Galleries, home to a collection of London-inspired artworks. These rooms can be hired together to create a unique experience for a reception. 
                  The Conference Room and Boardroom are fully equipped with multimedia and audio visual facilities, the perfect environment for client presentations and strategic meetings. 
                  The City Centre can provide catering for any event from our dedicated in-house chef or from our list of approved caterers, with innovative menus for breakfast, lunch and evening events using seasonal and sustainable produce.
                  *Please note, the Roman Amphitheatre and Undercroft Galleries are available to hire from 5pm.
