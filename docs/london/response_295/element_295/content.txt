              Overview

              The Banqueting House, Whitehall is the perfect place to entertain. Built for James 1 in 1622, it oozes quality, from the atmospheric Undercroft through to the magnificent Main Hall with its original Rubens' ceiling paintings. This last remaining fragment of the historic Palace of Whitehall is centrally located and so convenient for both the city and the West End. 
                  This flexible venue can accommodate 350 for dinner and up to 400 for a concert or reception. The Undercroft is ideal for more intimate occasions and accommodates 150 seated and up to 360 standing.
