              Overview

              Senate House has been an iconic presence on the capital’s skyline since 1936, but scratch the surface and you will find a thoroughly modern proposition. A three-year, multi-million pound refurbishment programme has preserved its most distinctive features propelling it into the upper echelons of the international events marketplace. 
                  From its formal events spaces to its more intimate meeting rooms, Senate House blends timeless elegance with leading-edge technology to bring gravitas or glamour to gatherings of all descriptions. Complemented by first-class catering and support services, the work of our event coordinators is focused on delivering memorable experiences, time and time again.
