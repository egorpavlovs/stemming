              Overview

              Kensington Palace provides an exceptional setting for both private and corporate events. Set amid the tranquillity of Kensington Gardens in the heart of West London, it has been a royal residence for over 300 years. 
                  Today, the palace offers a unique selection of rooms available for receptions and formal dinners ranging from the rich and luxurious King's Gallery to the tranquil and elegant Orangery.
                  A newly craated area in the entrance vestibule can accommodate up to 300 for a drinks reception, the centre piece being an amazing fibre optic light sculpture inspired by the lace of Queen Victoria's wedding dress.
