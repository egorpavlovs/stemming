                  The hotel has 206 luxury bedrooms and suites: many with views, 11 private dining and meeting rooms, 25m swimming pool and 6000 sq feet Leisure Club. 
                  Gillray's Steakhouse & Bar is open all day. All the produce is sourced within a 100 mile radius. The Market set menu changes seasonally or you can delight with choices from the A La Carte Menu and enjoy steak from O'Shea's at it's best. You can also have private use. 
                  Ideally located with close proximity to Westminster and Waterloo Underground Station and one hour away from London Heathrow Airport. Local attractions include the London Eye, London Aquarium, Westminster Abbey and Covent Garden.
