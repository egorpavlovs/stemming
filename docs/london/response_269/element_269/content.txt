              Overview

              BCD Meetings & Events acquired Zibrant Limited in July 2016.
                  We are industry leaders in live production, creative content, inspiring videos, engaging communications and flawless event management. 
                  Conference, congresses and events are always about more than the tangible service you’d expect from an agency. We provide the extra ideas that make you sit up and think differently. Whether you are organising a meeting for two people or an international conference for 10,000, our team of specialists can provide options to help you with logistics, creative content or support attendees, that meet your budget and requirements.
                  To support conferences, congresses and events we can offer a housing management service.  This department allows you to provide delegates and visitors with the lowest available accommodation rates, room blocks and, if required, an online solution that translates into 32 languages offering the latest online technology to support associations and conference organisers.
