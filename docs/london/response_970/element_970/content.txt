              Overview

              Corporate dinners and receptions
                  The Royal Observatory’s historic Flamsteed House is home to the elegant Octagon Room, with a very rare interior designed by Sir Christopher Wren, which was originally used for observing the stars. With soaring ceilings and 360 degree views over London, and featuring a portrait of Charles II who commissioned the building, it is an ideal setting for high-profile corporate dinners and receptions. 
                  Summer parties
                  The Meridian Courtyard is a superb outdoor entertaining area ideal for summer parties, and also boasts breath-taking panoramic views over London. Here, guests can enjoy drinks standing on the Prime Meridian of the world, where eastern and western hemispheres meet. 
                  Bespoke talks and tours
                  Enhance your evening with bespoke talks and tours, planetarium shows, lunar observations and telescope viewings led by our astronomy experts.
