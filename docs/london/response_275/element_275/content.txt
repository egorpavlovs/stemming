Take a trip to one of the capital’s two top shopping centres Westfield London and Westfield Stratford City. They contain all of the best luxury and high-street brands together with fabulous food areas for refuelling. Or head to the London Designer Outlet at Wembley for some bargain buys.
London’s West End shopping district gives you easy access to the best stores, whatever your tastes. Oxford Street is home to flagship retailers such as John Lewis and Selfridges, whereas Regent Street and Sloane Street have some mid-range to high end stores. Don’t forget Shaftesbury Avenue and St Martin’s Courtyard, off the main shopping area for fashion-forward brands, trendy homeware and top places for a bite to eat.
Alternatively, check out Carnaby Street, Seven Dials and Berwick Street for boutique brands, independent record stores, and bars and cafés ideal for resting and watching the world go by. In the evening, head to nearby Chinatown for crispy duck with pancakes and hoisin sauce.
For a trip out of London, visit Bicester Village for lots of exclusive offers and a VIP experience in luxury outlets such as Burberry, Jimmy Choo and Mulberry.
Radisson Blu Edwardian Hotels are all well located around the major shopping areas in London making it a natural fit for those multi day shopping trips.
Our expert convention bureau team can help you and your clients experience the best of what London has to offer, whatever you are looking for. Contact us to find out more.
