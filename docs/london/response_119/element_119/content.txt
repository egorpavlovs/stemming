If you're travelling to London on business, the Oyster card is the most effective way to travel around the city and is often a cheaper option as it is capped daily. A contactless payment card, the Oyster can be used on buses, London underground and overground trainlines, Thames Clipper river taxis and even the cable car that crosses the river Thames, allowing you and your business delegates to travel around London seamlessly, and without needing multiple tickets.
Save time and receive cheaper travel on group orders in London
Visitor Oyster cards are over 40% cheaper than buying paper tickets or single journeys by cash. The cards never expire so they can be used again and can be easily topped up at any London Underground station, DLR, Cable Car and overground, as well as at TfL Visitor Centres and most newsagents.
As an official Transport for London (TfL) distributor, the London Convention Bureau team can help you organise group orders of Visitor Oyster cards ahead of your event (for orders of minimum 50 cards), saving you precious time. A card costs £5 and comes already pre-loaded with your chosen amount of credit, so it’s ready to be used by your delegates (please allow 2 months for this process).
