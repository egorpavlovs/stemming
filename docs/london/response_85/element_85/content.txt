The colour to be seen in – Green at the Good Hotel
The Good Hotel was brought from Amsterdam to its new floating home on the Thames in 2016 and will stay for five years. Situated just around the corner from ExCeL London in the historic Royal Victoria Docks, it boasts a unique location and offer.
While planners have been able to hire the stylish Living Room since last September, this summer, make the most of the newly opened rooftop terrace. The oasis of green is designed to have a flavour of the New York High Line gardens and certainly has views of the UK capital’s skyline compete on the world stage!
Customise your event by contacting events@goodhotel.com
The unmistakable smell - BBQ at The Tower Hotel
There’s nothing quite like a sizzling summer barbecue. The Brasserie terrace at the Tower Hotel is the perfect place for al fresco entertaining on the river. Set back in St Katherine’s dock, close to Tower Bridge, The Tower of London and Butler’s Wharf, you can provide a view of many of London’s top tourist attractions away from the hustle and bustle.
For more information on personalising your event call +44 800 330 8005
Sounds of summer – Ibiza vibes at Building Six

With space for 700, the terrace at Building Six is one of the jewels in the O2’s venue crown. The perfect location for summer cocktails and al fresco nibbles. The relaxed Ibiza feel is created with the help of cool seating areas, heaters and even day beds. Think chic beer garden with the added benefit of a view over the river to die for. There’s even a Body Kinetic dance floor available to hire to experience the feel, as well as the sounds, of summer.
So whether it’s a club night feel or a cool corporate event you’re looking to create, this modern venue in North Greenwich will hit the right note.
Find out more about summer packages at sales@theo2.co.uk.
Games you won’t be able to keep your hands off – croquet and pétanque at Tobacco Dock

One of this summer’s hottest venues is Skylight at Tobacco Dock. From May to September, three levels of a former car park in East London have been transformed into one of London’s most imaginative new rooftop destinations.
Think modern urban garden party with traditional lawn games such as croquet and pétanque spiced up with tasty on-trend street food and all on the banks of the Thames, close to the financial and tech districts of the city. Each floor of the 600-capacity venue features a bar and at least one games court.
Visit skylightlondon.com or email tdvlsales@tobaccodocklondon.com for further information.
Impeccable taste - heritage cocktails at Hyatt Regency

This summer, The Churchill Bar & Terrace has partnered with the National Trust's Chartwell (Sir Winston Churchill’s family home) to bring a touch of serenity to the heart of the city. Treat guests to relaxing afternoons and balmy evenings on the terrace with eye-catching seasonal decoration and a menu bursting with delicious themed summer cocktails and British culinary classics.
Offer unique and exclusive drinks such as the Kitchen Garden featuring fresh Chartwell apple juice, pressed from their orchard apples and The Honeymoon, which takes inspiration from the Churchills’ Italian honeymoon and includes Extra Virgin Italian Olive Oil. Taste buds will be tickled by traditional British favourites with a twist from homemade sausage rolls to chilled beetroot and raspberry summer soup to rhubarb and raspberry sundaes.
Contact lonch.rfp@hyatt.com to discuss your event requirements.
For more advice and summer event recommendations contact the London & Partners convention bureau team.
