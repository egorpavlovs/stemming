Where better to host your medical meeting than in the heart of world-leading life sciences expertise? With centuries of ground-breaking medical history and billions of investment in future health discoveries, London is the perfect environment to host your next event.

Together with Oxford and Cambridge in the Greater South East, London boasts four of the world’s top 10 universities, the biggest talent pool for life science in Europe and thousands of researchers working in new ways and in new buildings all over the city. 
Inspirational speakers, impressive venues and industry-relevant cultural activities are all at your fingertips in London. Whether it’s a one-day conference or a multi-day congress you’re planning, we can help you choose from a diverse range of venues.Exciting new additions such as MedCity and the Francis Crick Institute complement historic event spaces such as the Royal College of Physicians, BMA House and 1 Wimpole Street which is part of the Royal Society of Medicine building.

“Only in London could we have taken advantage of such a strong network of institutions and expertise, providing a level of input that matched our audience. I was delighted.”
James McGough, Portfolio Director, Clarion Events

And for all those needing to abide by the UK ABPI code, we have a wealth of venues with the knowledge and experience to deal with all of your compliance requirements behind the scenes, ensuring the city provides a world-class infrastructure for your medical meeting.
With over 153,000 hotel rooms, a third of which are four-star, there will be a style and location to suit every budget. Radisson Blu Edwardian Hotels have prime locations in central London and Heathrow which can serve as both accommodation and venue space.
The hundreds of direct flights worldwide each day and the constant transport improvements, including the new Elizabeth Line, are making connectivity from outside the country into the centre of the city smoother and quicker than ever before.Need DMCs, EMCs or PCOs for ground support? Our in-house team can guide you every step of the way, free of charge.All this and more are reasons why London is chosen as the perfect destination for events such as the European Society of Cardiology’s (ESC) annual congress. After successfully hosting over 35,000 delegates for five days in 2015, it returns to ExCeL London in 2021.

“ESC congress choosing to return to our city really is an endorsement of the Mayor’s plan to help improve the health of Londoners and of the capital’s expertise in medical research. This is also a great vote of confidence in the city’s ability to organise and host a high-profile, very large-scale congress, following the incredibly successful 2015 event.”
Tracy Halliwell, Director of Business Tourism and Major Events, London & Partners
