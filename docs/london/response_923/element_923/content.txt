              Overview

              The Geffrye Museum is set in Grade I listed 18th-century almshouses surrounded by tranquil gardens in Hoxton, East London, just minutes north of the City of London.
                  The museum explores the home and home life from 1600 to the present day through a series of evocative period London living rooms and gardens.
                  The museum’s green and peaceful setting and proximity to the City make it an ideal venue for receptions, cocktail parties, press launches, talks and meetings. During the summer months, both the front lawns and period gardens can also be hired for events.
                  The museum is open to the public from 10am to 5pm every day except Monday. Our in-house caterers specialise in seasonal, locally sourced produce and can offer simple canapes and drinks, as well as sit down banquets.
                  Contact the events team for full details of available spaces and costs.
