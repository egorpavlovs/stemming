              Overview

              Few venues encapsulate the past and present so beautifully. Hold your event at the Museum of London Docklands and your guests will find themselves immersed in history, while gazing at the glittering skyline of Canary Wharf. 
                  Housed in a Georgian warehouse originally used to store rum, molasses and cotton, the museum is the only Grade-I listed building in Canary Wharf. The museum's Wilberforce and Quayside Rooms, with exposed brickwork and original pine interior, provide the setting for a variety of events for up to 240 guests.   
                  For daytime events, the museum has everything you need, whether it's a theatre-style conference venue for 270, or a boardroom for 16.
