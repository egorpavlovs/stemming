In our report, we explore the main factors bringing more association conferences to London, including:

Access to expert knowledge: London is a world-leading centre for business and finance, hosting 40% of the European Headquarters of the world’s top companies
London’s flourishing tech sector: Tech City, the largest tech ecosystem in Europe attracts a global business community looking to innovate and collaborate.
New investment in London’s life sciences sector: Cutting edge research centres like The Francis Crick Institute add value to a host of medical congresses, including Europe’s largest, the European Society of Cardiology.
Better conference infrastructure: great transport links, five international airports and new developments like Crossrail (the new high speed railway for London completing in 2019) make London Europe’s most accessible city.
The experience factor: London’s rich heritage and cultural offering, with an abundance of world famous attractions means that conference held in London often attract 10-20% more delegates.
