              Overview

              The O2 is a purpose built venue with state of the art facilities.  We can easily accommodate global conference of 20,000 people right through to meetings of 100 and everything in between. Few other venues can offer the variety in atmosphere and experience that we can: stand in the company of greats in our world famous arena; relax and network in our American Express Invites lounge; let loose in a vibrant club atmosphere; set your imagination free on one of our blank canvas Open Spaces or burn off some steam in with a leisure activity – we have it all. And better still, it’s all under one, iconic, roof.
