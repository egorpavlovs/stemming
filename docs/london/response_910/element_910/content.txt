              Overview

              The iconic Queen’s House offers spectacular views across the gardens of historic Greenwich to the River Thames and the contrasting skyscrapers of Canary Wharf beyond.  
                  The Great Hall
                  The striking beauty of this perfect 40-foot-cube Hall, with its original black-and-white geometric marble floor and views across the Thames, provides a spectacular setting for ceremonies and dinners for up to 120 guests.
                  Weddings ceremonies and receptions
                  The Orangery and South Parlours provide one of the most stylish locations in London for small wedding ceremonies and boutique wedding breakfasts for up to 50 guests. 
                  With breath-taking views across one of London's oldest royal parks, the Orangery and South Parlours is also perfect for toasting your marriage with a drinks reception. 
                  Undercroft
                  The vaulted Undercroft beneath the Great Hall offers an atmospheric party space for dancing and after-dinner entertainment, where further evening guests can be invited.
