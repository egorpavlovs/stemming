London is internationally known for its many cultural attributes: 215 museums, 857 art galleries, 66 Michelin-star restaurants, iconic theatre scene and many music festivals. These exceptional assets not only ensure holiday makers make the best memories, but are also part of the overall London experience that can impress your business delegates.

With more than 2,000 years of history, world heritage and historical sites, London offers unusual venues for events and can transport delegates into the Royal world. From the Tower of London to Westminster Abbey, the Tower Bridge Exhibition to Kensington Palace and Hampton Court, treat your delegates to a unique experience and make them feel like VIPs.
Did you know you could hire a museum or an art gallery for corporate events? From the magnificent gallery spaces of the Victoria & Albert Museum to the innovative and more modern rooms of the Science Museum or Tate Modern, the choice is yours to make depending on the theme, type or needs of your event.
With such a diverse cultural offer, London is the perfect place to host incentive groups and offers rich itineraries to corporates. A dazzling array of team building activities is available in the city: an afternoon tea cooking class, climbing up the O2 for stunning views, touring the city on a bike or an adrenaline-fuelled high-speed boat experience. Whatever your needs are, London has it.
And to finish the experience on a high, why not hire a private dining room? Small or large groups, sky-high restaurant or cruise dinner, fine dining or live music, there is something for every taste!
With so much to choose from, our team is the best placed to direct you and introduce you to our partners, from venues, restaurants to DMCs and attractions.
