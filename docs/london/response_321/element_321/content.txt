              Overview

              The R.S. Hispaniola offers unrivalled views over the river Thames, the Coca-Cola London Eye and the Houses of Parliament. These views can be enjoyed from the front and rear decks, or the fully air-conditioned The Upper Deck British Bar & Kitchen, which provides à la carte dining for lunch and dinner and accommodates both small and large groups. The Main Deck, Pinkton Parlour Bar and Officers’ Mess are exclusive private hire spaces.
                  The R.S. Hispaniola has a light yet intimate feel, and offers great flexibility with its adaptable floor space, decks, bars and dining areas. We offer a selection of events packages to personalise your event, from a DJ or a live band, to a string quartet or a singer. 
                  You can also brand the venue to suit your event. All decks of the R.S. Hispaniola are available for private hire.
                  We are two-minute walk from Embankment Tube station and Charing Cross Station. Waterloo Station and Westminster Station are also five and ten-minute walks away from R.S. Hispaniola.
