              Overview

              The River Thames is the most important waterway in the world and is also the home of MBNA Thames Clippers, London's leading riverboat service. As well as providing commuters and sightseers with a unique way to get around the capital, they also offer a deluxe and highly versatile corporate and private hire service. 
                  Whether transporting rock stars to sold out concerts, shaping the perfect intimacy of a wedding day or adding something special to a company function, their formula is simple – every client is different, so each charter must be individually designed to not just meet, but ultimately supersede, their needs.
