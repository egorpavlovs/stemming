              Overview

              Newly open for daytime functions, the new sky-high rooms by Events at The Gherkin are ideal for dining and celebratory gatherings in the heart of The City. Sitting high above London on the 38th floor of this Norman Foster designed building, the rooms were aptly named after clouds:  Alto, Cirrus, Stratus, Cumulus and Nimbus offer stunning vistas, catering excellence and impeccable service.  Designed with flexibility in mind, the new rooms provide a space for small, targeted conferences for 18 delegates or larger parties of up to 100 guests. Events, private dinners or conferences at the Gherkin are lavishly catered with menus that bring to life Searcys’ passion for British produce and seasonality.
                   
                  Booked individually the cloud-inspired rooms are ideal for 18 to 50 guests dependent on layout (Boardroom, Banquet, Theatre or Standing), while double rooms or whole floor booking allow for larger gatherings of up to 130 guests.
