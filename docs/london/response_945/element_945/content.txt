              Overview

              The Museum of Brands in Notting Hill houses the largest collection of consumer goods in the world. With 15,000 products the Museum has the unique ability to constantly stimulate idea-generating conversations.
                  This makes it a fantastic venue for a wide range of events. We have an assortment of adaptable event spaces for hire during the day and/or evening. Our spaces are bright and fresh with big windows and of course, there’s the unique grassy floor of our Conference space. You can hire the entire Museum at night for drinks receptions for up to 200 people and we can seat 80 people for dinner in the Branding Hall. Our Conference Space holds up to 100 people and is perfect for innovation sessions, away days, workshops, presentations and conferences. And to spark creative thinking, the Museum’s Time Tunnel reveals the evolution of branding and design from Victorian times to the present day. Evening hire of the Museum includes access to our award winning garden for drinks or summer BBQ's.
