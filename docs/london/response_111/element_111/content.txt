Pack your suitcase, board the Eurostar or take a direct flight from New York, Paris, Amsterdam  – or one of 348 cities worldwide. Arrive in London and step onto the Underground. Realise your event is minutes from Buckingham Palace, a short bus trip from Tate Modern, just a stroll to Big Ben, or even in the Natural History Museum.





Make yourself at home in one of 125,000 rooms, you’re spoilt for choice. Budget, luxury, B&B or boutique, the range of accommodation spans the city. There are a number of options to choose from on the doorstep of every venue.



Hear that? London has expert speakers. Lots of them. In fact, 37% of FT Global 500 have a presence in London, nearly 20% of their European Headquarters are based in the city and it’s home to more than 45 universities with experts in every field.

Soak up the history. With four UNESCO World Heritage sites, iconic landmarks and a fascinating royal culture, London is a living history lesson. There’s also more than 170 museums and 850 art galleries (including three of the world’s top ten).



Embrace creativity. From performance and street art to installations and architecture. With fashion statements from the catwalk to the Tube and a film set on every corner, tap into London’s world-leading talent and give your event the edge.



Immerse yourself. Whether your passions are technology, life sciences, shopping, fitness, sports or crafts, London has it all. You’ll find the latest trends, the most advanced ideas, global brands, thought leaders and more.



Culture vulture? London’s eclectic food scene offers artistic menus, pop-ups, food trucks and 64 Michelin starred restaurants – also available as venues. While away the afternoon at sprawling markets, check out a pub gig, classical concert or west-end show, performances are everywhere.
