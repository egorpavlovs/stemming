          Embracing Brand Experience in Western Europe
          
		In collaboration with FreemanXP and ExCeL, our new report looks at how to connect with audiences by leveraging the medium

Brand experience connects people, organisations, and cultures in ways that create positive change on a global and local scale. The medium also teaches us what our audiences value, and increasingly, it’s experiences over possessions.
To better understand the power of brand experience, we commissioned SSI to conduct an independent study of a range of B-to-B and B-to-C marketers in a variety of roles across Western Europe, North America and Asia, to uncover how they perceive brand experience, and it’s clear that the outlook for our industry is positive. 
Over the following pages, we delve into four key themes specific to Western Europe that we’ve identified from the 2017 Freeman Global Brand Experience Study, backed up by statistics and commentary from industry experts at agency FreemanXP, ExCeL London and London & Partners.
Read the insight report to learn more about brand experience, the effectiveness of this immersive activity , and the success this could bring to your event.
