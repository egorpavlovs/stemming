Background
In London we never forget that for events attendees, food and beverage should be more than simply a means of keeping hunger and thirst at bay. We know that refreshment breaks and meals should be a talking point and a feast for all the senses, and we have an army of catering professionals ready with memorable dishes that delight not only your event participants’ sense of taste but also their eyes.
The capital’s culinary scene has never been more vibrant than it is today. As well as featuring our excellent home-grown professionals it has long been enriched by the highly talented chefs it welcomes from all across the globe, attracted by the glorious diversity of London’s food and the scope for innovation.
An outstanding example of matching the power of taste with pure visual delight is the Marriott Hotel's platform, Meetings Imagined, an interactive online conference, events and meeting planning tool that helps organisers visualise, plan and implement their events. As well as showing the extensive range of possible room set-ups, Meetings Imagined portrays a series of visually stunning images of food and beverage suggestions for events.
Event design
Ian Pask, General Manager of the London Marriott Hotel explains the central role of catering in events: 'Food is an extremely important part of a meeting or event. Menus bring to life an organiser's theme through the imaginative presentation of dishes, smells and ingredients. By using the Meetings Imagined tool, the hotel’s meeting and events team are able to advise clients on unique ideas and concepts. At the Marriott, we always remember that you don’t just eat with your taste buds but with your eyes too, ensuring that our clients and guests are left with an unforgettable impression of the London Marriott Hotel'.

"Food is an extremely important part of a meeting or event. Menus bring to life an organiser's theme through the imaginative presentation of dishes, smells and ingredients."
Ian Pask, General Manager, London Marriott Hotel

The experience
What better evidence of this than the visually spectacular – and unforgettably delicious! – Dry-ice Lemon Posset dish, created by the hotel’s Head Chef? Every time it gets served up in special Tiptree Lemon Curd branded jam jars and swirling with the dry-ice vapour, the diners’ get out their mobile phones to photograph this amazing dessert before enjoying every mouthful.
The Dry-ice Lemon Posset is so popular it now features in more than 90 per cent of all menus chosen for meetings, events, conferences and banquets at the London Marriott.
