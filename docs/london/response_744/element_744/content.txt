              Overview

              The Tower of London has been at the heart of this country's history for over 900 years. Events for ten to 250 can be accommodated and guests will share the unique atmosphere of this royal palace and fortress. There are a number of areas within the Tower available for hire, either alone or in combination for banquets, meetings and receptions. Excellent audio-visual facilities are in place within the meeting/conference suite.
                  Private receptions in the Jewel House for up to 80 guests make a perfect start to your evening. You can also arrange private jewel house viewings in the morning before the fortress is open to the public.
