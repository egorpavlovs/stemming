A selection of new restaurants in London
The Frog HoxtonThis latest venture by British chef Adam Handling, The Frog Hoxton boasts a relaxed vibe, original drinks and surprising flavours. Diners can enjoy a meal à la carte, or try one of several tasting menus. The Frog Hoxton and its Iron Stag bar can both be privatised, and the restaurant also offers semi-hire for large groups that do not require exclusive use.
Prosecco HouseIndulge in some fizz at Prosecco House, in Tower Bridge, where guests can sample, buy and learn about DOCG Prosecco. They also offer a small cocktail menu and some Italian nibbles such as focaccia, bresaola and prosciutto di Parma.
Swingers Oxford StreetSwingers take crazy golf back to its seaside roots in a venue that reimagines the faded glamour of the English Riviera. Enter through a hidden entrance and discover two beautiful 9-hole crazy golf courses and a promenade lined with beach huts offering food and drink. Swingers offers a range of spaces for hire, capable of hosting events from 12 to 600.
Mariage FreresEducate your delegates in the art of tea with the new Mariage Freres emporium opening in Covent Garden. Taking over a Georgian townhouse, guests will find the largest collection of tea in the world, as well as and, as well as a shop, a tea museum and two private event spaces. The emporium can hold events for up to 50, with a private terrace and trade showroom
Cora PearlCora Pearl is the second restaurant from the team behind Kitty Fisher’s in Mayfair. Just like its sister restaurant, Cora Pearl is named after a British courtesan, and the menu reflects the time she spent in Paris through a mix of British and French influences. The restaurant has 60 covers set over two floors of a historic townhouse and is available for exclusive hire.
Kerridge’s Bar & Grill at the CorinthiaBritish Michelin-star chef Tom Kerridge’s first London restaurant is now open at the Corinthia Hotel London. The third restaurant inside the Corinthia Hotel will serve contemporary British food and rotisserie dishes, using the finest local produce. It will be housed in a new space designed by David Collins Studio.
Laurent at Café RoyalDiscover Laurent at Café Royal, the luxury hotel’s latest restaurant. The menu includes a selection of sashimi and sushi, as well as meat and fish from the grill.
