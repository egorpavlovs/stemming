			Ajman	
		
		
Ruler
H. H. Sheikh Humaid Bin Rashid Al Nuaimi is the Ruler of Ajman. As the 10th ruler of the emirate of Ajman, he succeeded his late father Sheikh Rashid bin Humaid Al Nuaimi on 6 September, 1981. He received his early education in Dubai in 1940 before proceeding to Cairo, Egypt, to continue his higher education. Soon after, H. H. became involved in the political affairs of the emirate and became the Deputy Ruler of Ajman. He held this position from 1960 to 1981. He is considered the founder of the new emirate of Ajman.
History
The Al Nuaimi tribe, who migrated to the region around 1775, formed Ajman. The first recognition of Ajman as an autonomous state was in 1820. The reign of the former Ruler of Ajman, late Sheikh Rashid Bin Al Nuaimi lasted 53 years, from 1928 to 1981.
How it was named
According to UAEPedia, the emirate was called ‘Aeyman', a slang word for Ajman. The name may be refers to Oman, the neighbouring region and the similarity in the topography of both areas.

However, there are other theories about how it was named. One of the theories is that it was named after a prominent Arab tribe named Ajman living in that area.
