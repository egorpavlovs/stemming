			Dhow Cruising in Musandam	
		
		Picture perfect sceneries. The Musandam Peninsula is an enclave of Oman that juts into the strategically important Strait of Hormuz. We board the traditional wooden Dhow around 11.00 am at Dibba port. Cruising around the scenic peninsula in the Gulf of Oman, you will have the opportunity of visiting remote fishing villages, snorkelling, deep sea fishing and swimming in the clear blue waters.

Explorer Tours will provide the following for this package:

 	Soft drinks and water
 	Lunch on the Dhow
 	Traditional fishing gear and bait
 	Life jackets (optional)
 	Round trip transfer Dubai – Dibba – Dubai
