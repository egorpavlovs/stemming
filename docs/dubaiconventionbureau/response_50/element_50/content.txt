			Dune Buggy Challenge	
		
		Our dune buggies are powerful and reliable on sand and at the same time are safer as they are equipped with a full roll cage, bucket seats and safety harness. A course will be setup in the desert and participants can score points based on their driving skills under the close supervision of a professional back up team for safety.
