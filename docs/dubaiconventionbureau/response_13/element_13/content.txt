	 INCENTIVE	
		Dubai For Incentive

 
The rapid growth of incentive travel in recent years has given organizers a major challenge… how to find somewhere new and different that combines variety and excitement with professional destination management services and top quality hotels.

There can be no better answer than “Dubai” – as an increasing numbers of incentive travel organizers are finding out. Dubai’s unique attraction is that it brings together in a single, accessible location the comforts and convenience of the western world with adventure of Arabia – from the bustling souks to the majestic desert. An exotic destination with a cosmopolitan lifestyle, Dubai has the right mix to make it the ideal solution for the incentive travel planner. The diversity of the pulsing city has changed in recent years from a less known travel destination to a world recognized and famous cosmopolitan city.

The mixture of Arabian Heritage and modern designs of buildings gives the destination a special touch with the best personal service. Incentive planners need to get the “kick” and Dubai has it!! Dubai is still a sufficiently well kept “secret” to excite the most jaded traveller, yet offers all the facilities and expertise you need to plan your incentive with confidence.

Dubai is the answer for the client who is looking for something exciting. Come to the United Arab Emirates, the ultimate incentive for an experience that is truly different. Your Company or Clients deserve the very best!!
