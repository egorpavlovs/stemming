History
Archaeological evidences indicate old civilisations in Ras Al Khaimah.

Its strategic location at the mouth of the Arabian Gulf has contributed to its economic and cultural exchange.

Trade has been an essential part of life in the region since 5000 B.C.

By the 10th  century, inhabitants of Ras Al Khaimah traveled  as far as Zanzibar, Bombay, and China.

The emirate is famous for its historical antiquities such as the Fort of Dhayah, the palace of Al Zabaa and the antiquities of Julfar city.

Ras Al Khaimah's strategic position made it a target for many invading powers.

The remains of the historic forts evidence Ras Al Khaimah's history and early settlements of  the Sassanid Persians, the Islamic of the Arabian Gulf, the Portuguese, the Dutch and the British empires.

In the early 18th  century, Al Qawasim tribe (the current ruling tribe of the emirate) set up a base in Ras Al Khaimah  and Sharjah and grew to be a significant maritime power on the Arabian Coast.

The British fought with Al Qawasim. The fight ended in a maritime treaty on 1820 and laid to  the foundation for the British Protectorate over the Trucial States that lasted until 1971.

In 1869, Ras Al Khaimah became fully independent from Sharjah and reincorporated once again from 1900 until 1921.

RAK was the last emirate to join the Federation on 10 February 1972.
How it was named
The name of the emirate literally means the peak of the tent, referring to the Queen of Al Zaba'a who built a tent on top of Shamal mountain.
