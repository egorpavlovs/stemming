			Emirates to unveil the new on-board lounge at ITB Berlin			
				Posted on March 4, 2017 by admin			
				
		
		Emirates, Skytrax’s World’s Best Airline 2016, will launch a series of new cabin products and enhancements in 2017 for both its A380 and Boeing 777 fleet.

According to Sir Tim Clark, President Emirates Airline, the A380 On-board Lounge is hugely popular with the Emirates customers, and has become an iconic feature of Emirates’ A380 offering.

The A380 On-board Lounge was launched in 2008 and has gone through small but successive enhancements in line with customer feedback to increase the amount of space for the customers to interact in the lounge.

The new Emirates A380 On-board Lounge will make its first public appearance at the Emirates Infinite Possibilities stand during ITB Berlin, one of the world’s largest tourism trade fairs. It is currently being installed onto one of Emirates’ brand new A380 aircraft at Airbus’ facilities, and will make its operational debut in July 2017.

While retaining the trademark horseshoe-shaped bar, Emirates’ latest A380 On-board Lounge will offer more seating space with a new seating arrangement along the windows on both sides of the bar.

Inspired by private yacht cabins, each seating area will have a table and window view. Overall, the lounge can comfortably accommodate up to 26 passengers at a time, including 8 seated.

The new On-board Lounge will also feature an airier look and feel. Lighter champagne colours will be used in the cabin and lounge seating, accented by a glossy dark wood trim.
Emirates will also introduce soundproof curtains to partition the On-board Lounge area from the other cabins, put in additional soft ambient lighting options, new window blinds with integrated LED mood lighting, and subwoofers for surround sound.
The lounge also features a 55 inch LCD screen so customers can view the latest flight information, or enjoy live TV broadcasts of the latest news or sports updates.

The enhanced lounge product will be located on the upper deck of the aircraft, for First and Business Class passengers.

At the lounge, customers can enjoy gourmet canapés, handpicked wines from around the world and limited edition fine spirits, as well as signature cocktails prepared by the bartender.

Aside from the On-board Lounge, the Emirates A380 is also renowned for its industry-leading First Class Private Suites and Shower Spas; luxurious lie-flat Business Class pods with personal mini-bars; spacious and quiet cabins; on board Wi-Fi; and Emirates’ multi-award winning ‘ice’ Digital Widescreen with more than 2,500 channels of movies, TV programs, music and podcasts.

Emirates flies the A380 to 46 cities on 5 continents. It is the world’s largest operator of the A380 aircraft with 93 of these double-decked aircraft in service, and a further 49 on order. Testimony to the popularity of the aircraft amongst travellers, Emirates has carried nearly 70 million passengers on its flagship aircraft since 2008.
