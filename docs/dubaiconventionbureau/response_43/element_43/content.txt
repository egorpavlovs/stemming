			A Goal seminar in the middle of the desert at sunset	
		
		The importance of having clear goals has been proven in research again and again!

“Achieve budget” might not be the most inspiring goal but for many companies in UAE it is the only clear goal they have. Now you can change that!
Bring your team out in the desert and work on setting truly inspiring goals that will pull all of you forward to a better future! With a clear “why” and “what” the “how” will be easy!

Putting a clear, good vision together requires much reflection. To reflect in a conference room leads to a tedious goal! We have therefore moved out of our conference room to the desert in Dubai!

We would like to welcome you to a seminar that will be an unforgettable evening for you and your company!
Our conference room in the middle of the desert:

How it works:
After an adrenaline-filled journey up and down the sand dunes you arrive in a valley where we have laid out rugs. Here we start with a 45 minute inspirational lecture and teach you everything you need to know about the art of setting goals.

After the lecture, participants get the chance to sit on the sand dunes and reflect with the help of some a set of questions. You will set your own goals while the sun goes down. After sunset, we summarize and conclude with dinner under the stars.
A unique experience that your conference participants will never forget!
After dinner there is time for further reflection by the bonfire, under the stars!

Duration – The seminar is 3 hours but the participants are welcome to stay as long as they like

Testimonial:

Enjoy the present and create your future’
“We had the opportunity to do this during our desert excursion!
Thanks for an unforgettable evening. This was the best evening of the entire Dubai stay.”
