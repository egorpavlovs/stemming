{{main|History of FC Bayern Munich}}

===Early years (1900–1965)===
[[File:Fcn-fcb1901.jpg|thumb|right|The first game of FC Bayern Munich against [[1. FC Nürnberg]] in 1901]]
FC Bayern Munich was founded by members of a Munich gymnastics club (MTV 1879). When a congregation of members of MTV 1879 decided on 27 February 1900 that the footballers of the club would not be allowed to join the [[German Football Association]] (DFB), 11 members of the football division left the congregation and on the same evening founded Fußball-Club Bayern München. Within a few months, Bayern achieved high-scoring victories against all local rivals, including a 15–0 win against FC Nordstern,<ref>{{cite news|title=Bayern fans bring club's earliest years to light|url=http://www.thelocal.de/20150522/fc-bayern-fans-early-history-rediscovered|accessdate=30 May 2015|publisher=The Local|date=22 May 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150525162232/http://www.thelocal.de/20150522/fc-bayern-fans-early-history-rediscovered|archivedate=25 May 2015}}</ref> and reached the semi-finals of the 1900–01 [[Southern German football championship|South German championship]].<ref name="fcbbook1stch"/> In the following years, the club won some local trophies and in 1910–11 Bayern joined the newly founded "Kreisliga", the first regional Bavarian league. The club won this league in its first year, but did not win it again until the beginning of [[World War I]] in 1914, which halted all football activities in Germany.<ref name = "bayernhistory0045"/><ref>{{cite book | last = Schulze-Marmeling | first = Dietrich | title = Die Bayern. Die Geschichte des deutschen Rekordmeisters | language = German | publisher = Die Werkstatt | year = 2003 | pages = 30–40 | isbn = 3-89533-426-X}}</ref> By the end of its first decade of founding, FC Bayern had attracted its first German national team player, Max ''Gaberl'' Gablonsky.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fcbayern.com/de/club/historie/meilensteine-seit-1900/1900-bis-1932-von-beginn-an-erfolgreich|title=Von Beginn an erfolgreich|last=Kwolek|first=Sarah-Luisa|date=13 July 2016|website=FC Bayern München|language=de|access-date=3 February 2019}}</ref> By 1920, it had over 700 members, making it the largest football club in Munich.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fcbayern.com/de/club/historie/meilensteine-seit-1900/1900-bis-1932-von-beginn-an-erfolgreich|title=Von Beginn an erfolgreich|last=Kwolek|first=Sarah-Luisa|date=13 July 2016|website=FC Bayern München|language=de|access-date=3 February 2019}}</ref> 

In the years after the war, Bayern won several regional competitions before winning its first South German championship in 1926, an achievement repeated two years later.<ref name = "bayernhistory0045" /><ref>{{cite book | last = Schulze-Marmeling | first = Dietrich | title = Die Bayern.

The advent of [[Nazism]] put an abrupt end to Bayern's development. Club president [[Kurt Landauer]] and the coach, both of whom were Jewish, left the country. Many others in the club were also purged. Bayern was taunted as the "[[Judenklub|Jew's club]]", while local rival [[TSV 1860 Munich|1860 Munich]] gained much support. Josef Sauter, who was inaugurated 1943, was the only NSDAP member as president. As some Bayern players greeted Landauer, who was watching a friendly in Switzerland lead to continued discrimination.<ref name="landauer">{{cite web | url = http://www.zeit.de/2003/23/Sport_2flandauer/komplettansicht | title = Onkel Kurt und die Bayern | language = de | publisher = Zeit Online | date = 28 May 2003 | accessdate = 16 October 2014 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141017200655/http://www.zeit.de/2003/23/Sport_2flandauer/komplettansicht | archivedate = 17 October 2014 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> Bayern was also affected by the ruling that football players had to be full amateurs again. In the following years, Bayern could not sustain its role of contender for the national title, achieving mid-table results in its regional league instead.<ref>{{cite book | last = Schulze-Marmeling | first = Dietrich | title = Die Bayern.

After the war, Bayern became a member of the [[Oberliga Süd (1945–63)|Oberliga Süd]], the southern conference of the German first division, which was split five ways at that time. Bayern struggled, hiring and firing 13 coaches between 1945 and 1963. Landauer returned from exile in 1947 and was once again appointed club president, the tenure lasted until 1951. He remains as the club's president with the longest accumulated tenure. Landauer has been deemed as inventor of Bayern as a professional club and his memory is being upheld by the Bayern [[ultras]] ''Schickeria''.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.br.de/fernsehen/bayerisches-fernsehen/sendungen/kurt-landauer-der-film/index.html | title = Kurt Landauer: Der Mann, der den FC Bayern erfand | language = de | publisher = [[Bayerischer Rundfunk]] | accessdate = 16 October 2014 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141015172638/http://www.br.de/fernsehen/bayerisches-fernsehen/sendungen/kurt-landauer-der-film/index.html | archivedate = 15 October 2014 | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.spiegel.de/sport/fussball/fc-bayern-muenchen-schickeria-ultras-erhalten-julius-hirsch-preis-a-997151.html | title = DFB-Auszeichnung: Bayern-Ultras erhalten Julius-Hirsch-Preis | language = de | publisher = Spiegel Online | date = 14 October 2014 | accessdate = 16 October 2014 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141018005832/http://www.spiegel.de/sport/fussball/fc-bayern-muenchen-schickeria-ultras-erhalten-julius-hirsch-preis-a-997151.html | archivedate = 18 October 2014 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> In 1955, the club was relegated but returned to the ''Oberliga'' in the following season and won the [[DFB-Pokal]] for the first time, beating [[Fortuna Düsseldorf]] 1–0 in the [[DFB-Pokal 1956–57#Final|final]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Schulze-Marmeling | first = Dietrich | title = Die Bayern.

Five teams from the Oberliga South were admitted. Bayern finished third in that year's southern division, but another Munich team, 1860 Munich, had won the championship. As the DFB preferred not to include two teams from one city, Bayern was not chosen for the Bundesliga.<ref name="nobl"/> They gained promotion two years later, fielding a team with young talents like [[Franz Beckenbauer]], [[Gerd Müller]] and [[Sepp Maier]]&nbsp;— who would later be collectively referred to as ''the axis''.<ref name = "bayernhistory4667" />

===The golden years (1965–1979)===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-N1108-304, Fußball-Europapokalspiel, Magdeburg - München.jpg|thumb|left|FC Bayern Munich against 1. FC Magdeburg in 1974]]
In their first Bundesliga [[1965–66 Bundesliga|season]], Bayern finished third and also won the [[DFB-Pokal 1965–66|DFB-Pokal]]. This qualified them for the following year's [[1966–67 European Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]], which they won in a dramatic [[1967 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|final]] against Scottish club [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], when [[Franz Roth]] scored the decider in a 1–0 [[Overtime (sports)|extra time]] victory.<ref name = "bayernhistory4667" /> In 1967, Bayern retained the [[DFB-Pokal 1966–67|DFB-Pokal]], but slow overall progress saw [[Branko Zebec]] take over as coach. He replaced Bayern's offensive style of play with a more disciplined approach, and in doing so achieved the first [[1968–69 Bundesliga|league]] and [[1968–69 DFB-Pokal|cup]] [[Double (association football)|double]] in Bundesliga history in 1969. Bayern Munich are one of four German clubs to win the Bundesliga and DFB-Pokal in the same season along with [[Borussia Dortmund]], [[1. FC Köln]] and [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]]. Zebec used only 13 players throughout [[1968–69 FC Bayern Munich season|the season]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Schulze-Marmeling | first = Dietrich | title = Die Bayern.

[[Udo Lattek]] took charge in 1970. After winning the [[DFB-Pokal 1970–71|DFB-Pokal]] in [[1970–71 FC Bayern Munich season|his first season]], Lattek led Bayern to their [[1971–72 Bundesliga|third German championship]]. The deciding match in the [[1971–72 FC Bayern Munich season|1971–72]] season against [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]] was the first match in the new [[Olympiastadion (Munich)|Olympiastadion]], and was also the first live televised match in Bundesliga history. Bayern beat Schalke 5–1 and thus claimed the title, also setting several records, including points gained and goals scored.<ref>{{cite book | last = Schulze-Marmeling | first = Dietrich | title = Die Bayern.

During the following years, the team was unsuccessful domestically but defended their European title by defeating [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] in the [[1975 European Cup Final]] when Roth and Müller secured victory with late goals. "We came back into the game and scored two lucky goals, so in the end, we were the winners but we were very, very lucky", stated Franz Beckenbauer. [[Billy Bremner]] believed the French referee was "very suspicious". Leeds fans then rioted in [[Paris]] and were banned from European football for three years.<ref name="Unlucky match for Leeds">{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1999/05/99/uniteds_euro_showdown/347144.stm | title = Unlucky Paris match for Leeds | date = 19 May 1999 | work = BBC Sport | publisher = British Broadcasting Corporation | accessdate = 29 March 2012 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130615124716/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1999/05/99/uniteds_euro_showdown/347144.stm | archivedate = 15 June 2013 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> A year later in [[Glasgow]], [[AS Saint-Étienne|Saint-Étienne]] were [[1976 European Cup Final|defeated]] by another Roth goal and Bayern became the third club to win the trophy in three consecutive years.

In 1977, Franz Beckenbauer left for [[New York Cosmos (1971–1985)|New York Cosmos]] and, in 1979, Sepp Maier and [[Uli Hoeneß]] retired while Gerd Müller joined the [[Fort Lauderdale Strikers (1977–83)|Fort Lauderdale Strikers]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Schulze-Marmeling | first = Dietrich | title = Die Bayern.

===From FC Breitnigge to FC Hollywood (1979–1998)===
The 1980s were a period of off-field turmoil for Bayern, with many changes in personnel and financial problems. On the field, [[Paul Breitner]] and [[Karl-Heinz Rummenigge]], termed ''FC Breitnigge'', led the team to Bundesliga titles in [[1979–80 Bundesliga|1980]] and [[1980–81 Bundesliga|1981]]. Apart from a DFB-Pokal win in [[1981–82 DFB-Pokal|1982]], two relatively unsuccessful seasons followed, after which Breitner retired and former coach Udo Lattek returned. Bayern won the DFB-Pokal in [[DFB-Pokal 1983–84|1984]] and went on to win five Bundesliga championships in six seasons, including a [[Double (association football)|double]] in [[1985–86 FC Bayern Munich season|1986]]. European success, however, was elusive during the decade; Bayern managed to claim the runners-up spot in the European Cup in [[1981–82 European Cup|1982]] and [[1986–87 European Cup|1987]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Schulze-Marmeling | first = Dietrich | title = Die Bayern. Die Geschichte des deutschen Rekordmeisters | language = German | publisher = Die Werkstatt | year = 2003 | pages = 226–267 | isbn = 3-89533-426-X}}</ref>

[[Jupp Heynckes]] was hired as coach in 1987, but after two consecutive championships in [[1988–89 Bundesliga|1988–89]] and [[1989–90 Bundesliga|1989–90]], Bayern's form dipped. After finishing second in [[1990–91 Bundesliga|1990–91]], the club finished just five points above the relegation places in [[1991–92 Bundesliga|1991–92]]. In [[1993–94 FC Bayern Munich season|1993–94]], Bayern was eliminated in the [[1993–94 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] second round to [[Premier League]] side [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], who remain the only English club to beat Bayern at the Olympiastadion. Success returned when Franz Beckenbauer took over for the second half of the 1993–94 season, winning the [[1993–94 Bundesliga|championship]] again after a four-year gap. Beckenbauer was then appointed club president.<ref>{{cite book | last = Schulze-Marmeling | first = Dietrich | title = Die Bayern.

His successors as coach, [[Giovanni Trapattoni]] and [[Otto Rehhagel]], both finished trophyless after a season, not meeting the club's high expectations.<ref name="bayernhistory9199">{{cite web | title = 1990 bis 1999: Trainerwechsel und Titel | trans-title = 1990 to 1999: Titles and Changes of Managers | publisher = FC Bayern Erlebniswelt | accessdate = 28 September 2014 | url = http://fcb-erlebniswelt.de/de/historie/meilensteine-ab-1900/1990-1999/index.php | language = de | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150403095829/http://fcb-erlebniswelt.de/de/historie/meilensteine-ab-1900/1990-1999/index.php | archivedate = 3 April 2015 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> During this time, Bayern's players frequently appeared in the gossip pages of the press rather than the sports pages, resulting in the nickname ''FC Hollywood''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/174/uefa-champions-league/2010/04/08/1869197/cl-comment-van-gaals-bayern-give-new-meaning-to-fc-hollywood |title=CL Comment: Van Gaal’s Bayern Give New Meaning to "FC Hollywood" |publisher=Goal.com |date=8 April 2010 |accessdate=9 June 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140118141258/http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/174/uefa-champions-league/2010/04/08/1869197/cl-comment-van-gaals-bayern-give-new-meaning-to-fc-hollywood |archivedate=18 January 2014  }}</ref> Franz Beckenbauer briefly returned at the end of the [[1995–96 Bundesliga|1995–96]] season as caretaker coach and led his team to victory in the [[1995–96 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]], beating [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]] in the [[1996 UEFA Cup Final|final]].

After his success at Borussia Dortmund, Bayern were coached by [[Ottmar Hitzfeld]] from 1998 to 2004. In Hitzfeld's [[1998–99 FC Bayern Munich season|first season]], Bayern won the [[1998–99 Bundesliga|Bundesliga]] and came close to winning the [[1998–99 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]], losing 2–1 to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] into injury time after leading for most of the [[1999 UEFA Champions League Final|match]].

Prior to the start of the [[2005–06 Bundesliga|2005–06 season]], Bayern moved from the Olympiastadion to the new [[Allianz Arena]], which the club shares with 1860 Munich.

Hitzfeld returned as a trainer in January 2007, but Bayern finished the [[2006–07 Bundesliga|2006–07 season]] in fourth position, thus failing to qualify for the [[2007–08 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] for the first time in more than a decade. Additional losses in the [[2006–07 DFB-Pokal|DFB-Pokal]] and the [[2007 DFB-Ligapokal|DFB-Ligapokal]] left the club with no honours for the season.

For the [[2007–08 FC Bayern Munich season|2007–08 season]], Bayern made drastic squad changes to help rebuild. They signed a total of eight new players and sold, released or loaned out nine of their players.<ref>Bayern Magazin: 1/59, pages: 16–21, 11 August 2007 (in German)</ref> Among new signings were [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] stars such as [[Franck Ribéry]], [[Miroslav Klose]] and [[Luca Toni]].
