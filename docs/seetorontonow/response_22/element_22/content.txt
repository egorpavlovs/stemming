        Partnership
        Tourism Toronto is committed to developing mutually beneficial partnerships, sponsorships and related programs.
      
        
  
    
    
    
           
      

      Premium Partnership

      Building on Enhanced Membership, the Premium Partnership is for the business that wants the highest level of exposure and profile both with customers and as leaders in the region’s tourism community. Premium includes a customized marketing strategy to help you reach visitors across all business lines. With all the tools available to you, your company will be positioned in front of meeting professionals, business travellers and leisure visitors through a variety of communication channels, as well as to local businesses and government leaders.

      
    

    
    
           
      
      Strategic Marketing Partnerships
      Tourism Toronto strives to create strategic alliances with companies and brands who share similar goals. Our strategic marketing partnerships are designed to combine efforts and resources to have a greater impact and reach with a shared audience, and drive more business and visitors to Toronto.
      
    

    

           
    
      Sponsorship
      Sponsorship with Tourism Toronto provides opportunities to connect with an exclusive group of tourism professionals, and offers authentic and meaningful engagement with Tourism Toronto stakeholders, partners, and clients. It builds your influence with global meeting planners, industry leaders, international tour operators, and international travel media, all driving business and billions of dollars to Toronto each year.
      Contact Tourism Toronto to find out how sponsorship can showcase your company’s capabilities and specialties, strengthen relationships, broaden your exposure to new clients and partners and enhance your company’s profile. Consider supporting the Tourism community through unique and visible partner integration at our events and activities.
