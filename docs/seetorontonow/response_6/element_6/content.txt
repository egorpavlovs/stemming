      Marketing
      
      The Marketing arm of Tourism Toronto supports all areas of the business. It strives to showcase the city as a remarkable business and leisure destination by telling the Greater Toronto story through integrated consumer campaigns and strategic media and public relations. In support of this, the Media Relations team provides assistance to journalists at home and abroad filing stories about Toronto as a travel destination. We offer help with story development and are available to provide resource materials and background information on Toronto and its various neighbourhoods.
