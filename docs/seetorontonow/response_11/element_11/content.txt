        About Membership

        Working with Tourism Toronto connects your business to the visitor economy. The Toronto region remains the most-visited destination in Canada with 42 million visitors each year who spend $8.8 billion annually.

        Tourism Toronto can help you increase visibility in key markets and to those visiting Toronto. Membership allows you to extend your reach through digital and marketing content. It provides access to valuable resources including educational workshops, networking events, and the sharing of knowledge and best practices with industry leaders. It allows you to become an important part of the tourism business community.

        Working with Tourism Toronto puts your business in front of visitors and new customers when they need it most – in trip planning stages and once they’ve arrived.

        Membership is based on the following three pillars:

        EXPOSURE: Extend your reach to the 42 million visitors to Toronto through marketing opportunities. Put your business in front of millions of potential customers through Tourism Toronto’s website, print and digital publications, media opportunities and through our sales teams.

        KNOWLEDGE: Gain a better understanding of visitors to the city through reports and insights. Be better prepared for changes in the marketplace and learn how to grow your business through the Tourism EDGE Event Series, monthly educational events and seminars that cover everything from marketing and social media to understanding different segments of the visitor market.

        COMMUNITY: Become a part of a strong network of businesses. Stay connected and strengthen relationships with peers and industry leaders through networking opportunities, while staying up-to-date with industry trends and news.
        
      
    
    
    
    
           
      
        
        Membership Benefits

        Membership offers a choice of two tiered member levels designed to align your budgets, marketing objectives and business goals with travellers and opportunities. It offers a variety of ways for engagement and allows your business to plan ahead, in line with budget cycles.

        All pricing is based on 12-month membership from January to December 2018.

        MEMBER LEVEL: For companies that are interested in reaching the visitor market and staying connected with Tourism Toronto and Member businesses. This level includes customizable listings, opportunities to build relationships in the industry with access to valuable networking events and some educational opportunities.

        ENHANCED LEVEL: For companies looking for a more dynamic approach and additional marketing opportunities. This level includes increased exposure and a direct booking opportunity targeting consumers and leisure travellers.

        ENHANCED PROMO PACKS: For companies that would like to enhance specific engagement – either increase their marketing impact, build on their social presence, or lift their profile with the many conventions and business meetings that take place in our destination. The packs are geared towards increasing exposure either with consumers or with business events. Enhanced members are eligible to purchase Enhanced Promo Packs at an additional cost.
