            Relax, Recharge, Renew
        
        
    
    
       
        
            
            
            Provide A Much-Deserved Break
            
            The Relax, Recharge, Renew program provides parents of children with special needs a much-deserved break. Tourism Toronto, with the assistance of partners, provides weekend packages that include a limousine pick up, a two-night hotel stay, tickets to museums and other attractions, and meals at local restaurants. Families benefit from these weekend getaways every week throughout the year.
            
            The child with special needs may be cared for in one of several high-quality, provincially-funded respite care centres. Under coordination of RespiteServices.com, the remarkable respite care facilities partnered on this program are Safehaven, Holland Bloorview Kids Rehab, Community Living Toronto and Erinoakkids.
            
            Participating families are identified by respite providers. Families interested in learning more about the program and how to participate should contact their respite providers or RespiteServices.com.
            
            In only a few years of operation, Relax, Recharge, Renew has been recognized by a variety of prestigious local and international organizations for exceptional corporate social responsibility. Awards and recognition include:
            
            
            	Power of A Silver Award – ASAE (U.S.-based association)
                Commitment to the Community Award – IMEX (presented in Frankfurt, Germany)
                CSR Award for Community Affairs – PR News (presented in Washington, D.C.)
                Tourism Innovator of the Year – Tourism Industry Association of Ontario
                Destination Champion – Destination Marketing Association International
            
            
            If you wish to make a contribution to the program either in kind (providing hotel rooms, tickets, restaurant meals) or a monetary donation, we would love to hear from you. Please contact Lindsay Cowell at 416-203-3815 or lcowell@torcvb.com.
