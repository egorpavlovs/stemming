                    DESCRIPTION
                    The Hotel Europark is situated at carrer Aragó 323-325, just a 5-minute walk from Passeig de Gràcia. Our 3-star hotel in the centre of Barcelona gives you the opportunity to explore on foot: stroll down via Gran Via to Plaça de Catalunya, the Ramblas and the city's Gothic Quarter.The Hotel Europark is also very well placed for Barcelona's Modernista route: the Sagrada Familia, La Pedrera, the Casa Batlló, Casa Lleó i Morera, Casa de les Punxes and Casa Amatller are all within easy reach.The 105 rooms showcase a daring combination of classic and contemporary style, through the use of fabrics, black and white lacquered woods, chrome steel and highly avant-garde furnishings like the Panton Chair, courtesy of the Danish designer Verner Panton, all of which gives the rooms an air of originality and elegance.
