                    DESCRIPTION
                    Situated in the centre of Barcelona, the Hotel Claris is housed in a stunning 19th-century neoclassical building, the former Palau Vedruna. The hotel has 124 guest rooms and a number of meeting rooms (for 10 to 140 people). You can take time out at its cocktail bar East 47, and relax on the roof terrace, La Terraza del Claris, which has a restaurant that is open all year round due to its sliding roof and windows. It hosts live music in summer. The rooftop also has the Sala Garden, a swimming pool, sauna and gym. The hotel has an outstanding collection of Pre-Columbian art and more than 70 Egyptian artefacts of great artistic and historic value which are on display at its museum.
