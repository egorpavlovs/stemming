                    DESCRIPTION
                    7 Portes bears witness to years of history and momentous events, important decisions and wonderful times. It is a classic that has kept up with the times for the past 178 years. The restaurant stands beneath the porticoes known as “els porxos d’en Xifré” and was the first modern building in Barcelona to receive running water when it was built in 1836. It was also the backdrop for the first photograph ever taken in Spain.Its clear commitment to traditional Catalan cuisine is its calling card, along with its carefully chosen wine cellar and excellent, polite service in a welcoming atmosphere which reflect its historic, architectural and artistic values.7 Portes opens every day of the year with non-stop service from1pm to 1am and live piano music every night.
