                1Barcelona is just the right size: not too big, not too small. You can nip between the most interesting sights , by cycle -thanks to an extensive network of bike lanes-, by walking or public transport , and you can soon get to the must-see sights in your free time. In Barcelona, everything is close at hand !2Thanks to its great weather, diet, and above all, its character, you will see the true meaning of the word 'Mediterranean' in Barcelona. You can feel its cosmopolitan and dynamic spirit in the air and you actually live the Mediterranean experience. This magic draws you out onto the streets to stroll and enjoy the city's five kilometres of Mediterranean beaches.3And what history: over 2000 years of it! You´ll come across Roman ruins , Gothic treasures and surprises from the Renaissance age. Visiting the different corners of Barcelona is an authentic journey through time. 4Picasso, Miró, Dalí, Gaudí, Tàpies... they were in their time at the vanguard of their movements and their testing-ground was Barcelona. That creative flair and typical Catalan restlessness is very much part of the city today and this is reflected in the buildings, exhibitions , and the design and art that you'll find in the most unexpected places .5All you have to do is get on a plane to Barcelona: the city has excellent air connections to the vast majority of Spanish, European and major intercontinental destinations. As well, the airport is just 15 minutes from the city centre. You make the most of your time when you come to Barcelona!6Whether for large conferences or more intimate gatherings, Barcelona has just the right facility. Imagine a banquet in a charming historic place ? Or perhaps a cutting-edge facility for that unbeatable presentation? There's such a variety of welcoming and modern hotels.7In Barcelona we are very aware of the importance of protecting the environment, our resources and social surroundings while preserving our culture and traditions. 
That is why Barcelona has become the first city in the world to be awarded Biosphere certification, providing a guarantee that the city manages tourism responsibly and sustainably. 
Barcelona is also a barrier-free city, which is ready to welcome visitors with disabilities, and approaches accessibility with town planning, transport, IT, buildings and public spaces in mind.

8Maybe the locals walk fast, but they always find a moment to chat. We know that a smile is the best calling card, and in Barcelona you will find lots! With a smile , the day starts much better.9Every time you come to Barcelona, there's a nice surprise: a unexpected event or market, an outdoor concert, a fun-run to watch, an impromptu street party, an alternative-type festival ... Things are always happening in Barcelona, and that's why no one gets bored here!10Barcelona has always been a welcoming city. Today you'll find more than 160 different nationalities here: a melting pot of cultures and languages that make it an example of coexistence and dynamism.

                            “It is with much enthusiasm that we are writing to thank the Barcelona Convention Bureau team for their support in the preparation of the ESC Congress 2017 that took place in Barcelona from 26 to 30 August.
The local knowledge and support of the team, with a special tribute to Ms. Monica Garcia, combined with the hospitality of the city highly contributed to make this congress a very successful event.
With excellent infrastructure and a state of the art congress venue (Fira Gran Via) the city of Barcelona welcomed an international participation of over 31 000 cardiovascular healthcare professionals.
It was a pleasure working with the Barcelona Convention Bureau and the many local partners.

Besides the fact of a marvelous climate end of October, the hospitality as well in the city but more over in the Congress Centre (CCIB) and its surrounding hotels convinced the entire Nuclear Medicine Community to share their knowledge and findings within their field of expertise with an “all-time high number of almost 6.500 participants”.  We are already now very much looking forward to coming back again in 2019.

They helped us with many aspects of the organization and facilitated the relations with  local suppliers. But it was certainly after the terrorist attack that they demonstrated support and determination. Despite the recent difficulties the City remains very attractive and inviting. ”

Accessibility to Barcelona–El Prat Airport from around the world, a high-quality and diverse housing package, great public transportation system, innovative and functional meeting space and exhibition halls at the Fira Barcelona Gran Via along with high-level service and execution, helped to make our city-wide convention a big success.  We had terrific support from the CVB and our housing and event partner that helped us achieve our meeting goals.

In their own words, Barcelona is a captivating, cosmopolitan city, with history and culture, perfect weather, good food and good professionals that guarantee a memorable stay in the city. If we add to all this to a top-class, medical-scientific meeting, then the combination is "the perfect conference".”

They also applauded the professionalism and reliability of local organizations' commitments to the meeting, especially in terms of unforeseen events.”

Holding the Conference “Equality and Security” in the city provided a unique opportunity to raise the profile of women in police organisations,  where we are still in the minority, both internationally and locally
 
Barcelona is proud of its position as an international reference point in the field of equality in security. The aim of our Conference, safely hosted  in the Congress Palace, was to reflect these values and give visibility to the role of women in security
 
Thanks to the efforts of all involved we achieved our goals and the conference proved to be an enriching experience for our delegates, the volunteers and us as organisers. 
 
We, women in policing,  are very grateful  to Barcelona City Council, Fira de Barcelona,  Barcelona Turisme Convention Bureau and local companies involved  for their contribution to making the Conference a success.
