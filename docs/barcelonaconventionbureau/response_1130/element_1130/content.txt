                    DESCRIPTION
                    Ohla Barcelona is a 5-star hotel based in the heart of Barcelona. Ideally located for tourism, shopping and business alike, it offers a whole world of experience, high-quality service and pleasure. The city bustle establishes a smooth harmony with the calm and serenity inside.The building has been immaculately preserved, and the heritaged facade as well as other elements such as the main staircase, have been provided with an avant-guard design combining black and white colours with oak wood textures.Most noteworthy is the sculptural intervention on the facade by Frederic Amat. The Hotel Ohla Barcelona is situated in Via Laietana, a main avenue connecting the historical centre with the Mediterranean coast. It has an strategic location between the three most commercial and busy districts in town: The Gothic, The Borne and the Eixample.The gastronomic spaces at Ohla Barcelona are well known and also a meeting-point for the locals and guests: Caelis restaurant, culinary restaurant awarded with a Michellin star; La Plassohla, located on the ground floor in a luminous and casual space, this restaurant offers high-level 'tapas' and original dishes; and Vistro49, wine and cocktail bar in the heart of Barcelona.
