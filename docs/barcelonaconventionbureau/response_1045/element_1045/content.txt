                    DESCRIPTION
                    The H10 Art Gallery is a newly-built hotel inspired by the world of contemporary art. Its exquisite collection of original works and prints by internationally renowned artists such as Joan Miró and Miquel Barceló makes it a genuine artistic treasure. With an interior design characterised by clean lines, this exclusive 4-star superior hotel boasts modern rooms, the Modern Art restaurant and the Pop Art cafeteria, which provides access to the charming Olivera terrace, named after the one hundred-year-old olive tree there. On the top floor, guests can enjoy the Inspire terrace, with a plunge pool and hammock area ? an oasis in the middle of the city.The hotel is situated in the emblematic Eixample district, in a partially pedestrianised area just a few minutes from Passeig de Gràcia, Rambla de Catalunya and Avenida Diagonal. This is the ideal location for all those who are looking for peace and quiet, but who wish to stay close to the city's business and retail hub.
