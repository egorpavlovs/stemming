                    DESCRIPTION
                    Ohla Eixample is a brand new 5-star boutique hotel located in the heart of the modernist Eixample district in Barcelona, in between the emblematic Diagonal Avenue and the shopping street Rambla de Catalunya. It is a modern, urban building that defines itself through the attention to detail, the use of high quality materials and industrial finishing’s, combining maximum functionality, new technology and architectural creativity.This ambitious and unique project presents an outstanding ceramic facade with an extraordinary design: more than 1000 pieces carved by a robotic interpretation of Vivaldi’s Four Seasons. The result is a composition of an amazing façade providing a spectacular landmark and is an eye catcher for those passing by.This refurbished building offers a universe of different experiences thanks to the personality and comfort of its bedrooms, a hidden garden patio and a rooftop with an astonishing and heated pool, unique in Barcelona. The finest gastronomy coexists between Xerta Restaurant (haute cuisine from the Ebro Delta recognized with a Michelin star), the Lobby Bar (meeting point for both locals and hotel guests), and the Sky Bar (creative cocktails and genuine city sights). A delicate and personalized service will help you to create an unforgettable stay.
