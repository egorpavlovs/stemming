                    DESCRIPTION
                    Situated at Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes, 642, the Hotel Granvía was built in the late 19th century as a palace for the Catalan bourgeoisie.  It enjoys a superb location opposite Passeig de Gràcia metro station and two minutes' walk from Plaça de Catalunya. It is also very near Gaudí's masterpieces La Pedrera and the Casa Batlló, the Ramblas and the Palau de la Música Catalana, among many other tourist sights.The 58 rooms feature free Wi-Fi, individual air conditioning, a safe deposit box with room for a laptop, and a private bathroom (bath / shower) with a hair dryer and amenities. The hotel also offers a terrace, reading room, Business Centre, lift and buffet breakfast.The terrace is an oasis in the centre of Barcelona, somewhere to relax and enjoy the sun, the silence and those little pleasures that we very often forget about in the city: reading, an iced tea, a chat with a close friend, an unhurried beer?
