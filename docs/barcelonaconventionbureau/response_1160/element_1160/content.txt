                    DESCRIPTION
                    Comfortable, 4-star boutique hotel in the Esquerra Eixample district between Plaça d’Espanya and Plaça Universitat, close to the Sant Antoni food market and Montjuïc. Its location makes it the perfect choice for visitors looking for a central hotel away from the crowds. The Villa Emilia had 53 spacious and light guest rooms. They all have double beds and are soundproofed. Every last detail has been taken care of, from the designer furniture to Egyptian cotton sheets and top-quality mattresses, to create the perfect combination of elegance and comfort. At the Hotel Villa Emilia you will be able to enjoy live music (see listings on the hotel website) and excellent bistro food at our Zinc-Bar restaurant. La Terrassa, with its chill-out ambiance, is one of our guests’ favourite places. The Hotel Villa Emilia has two meeting rooms: the Salón Rojo, a large multipurpose and flexible air-conditioned space for conferences, presentations or executive meetings; and El Privat, a private room for the times when you need concentration and focus. Whether you want to plan a professional or private event, we have different areas that will meet your needs.
