                    DESCRIPTION
                    The Hotel España 4* is located in the historic heart of Barcelona, just off La Rambla. The hotel originally opened in 1859 under the name Fonda de España and was refurbished by the celebrated modernista architect Lluís Domènech i Montaner in the early 20th Century.The hotel underwent a complete refit in 2010 to bring back its original spirit as conceived by Domènech i Montaner. The modernista spaces have been painstakingly restored to their original design, highlights being the sgraffito frescoes by Ramón Casas in the Mermaid Room and the fireplace by the sculptor Eusebi Arnau. The Hotel España has 82 guest rooms equipped with state-of-the-art technology; unique meeting and events rooms; the Fonda España restaurant; the Bar Arnau and the spectacular Alaire Ramblas rooftop terrace. The hotel restaurant is supervised by chef Martín Berasategui.
