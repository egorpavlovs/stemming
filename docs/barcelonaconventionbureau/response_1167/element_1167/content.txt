                    DESCRIPTION
                    Eating at IKIBANA is a truly unique experience with every detail designed to stimulate the senses. A gastronomic journey where you’ll discover different flavours, textures, aromas and culinary techniques through fusion dishes that respect pared-back, painstaking attention to detail with an explosion of flavours, colours and products. We take care of every last detail with innovative, cutting-edge solutions to offer a unique experience that transcends the simple menu. The restaurant design recreates a constantly moving landscape consisting of natural, noble materials like leaves and wood that act as a curtain that diffuses the light, creating an intimate and cosy space. The spectacular ceiling resembles a forest of intertwining branches bringing warm contrasts of light and shadow. Our tables, like islands, are an explosion of tropical colours, while our curved cocktail bars are reminiscent of ancient boats. At IKIBANA we’re just crazy about cocktails and our extensive list is designed for cocktail connoisseurs and novices.
