                    DESCRIPTION
                    At Cal Blay are professionals in the gastronomy and put all our efforts to ensure that each catering service will be a success. Presentations, celebrations, fairs, conventions, premieres or award ceremonies with the largest volume of guests, represent for us a great challenge and an added motivation. We can do events ranging from 300 to 3,000 people, an extensive experience it’s our guarantee. We have the best spaces, a highly trained and coordinated team who will make that your events get bigger. With every dish we prepare, with every meal and every catering, our adventure starts over again and again: the passion for good food.
