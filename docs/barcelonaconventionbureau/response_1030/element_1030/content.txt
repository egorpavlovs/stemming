                    DESCRIPTION
                    Arenal Restaurant is located right on the beach and specialises in rice dishes and paellas. From its privileged position, with one foot in the sand and the sea as its backdrop, Arenal Restaurant invites you to enjoy a culinary experience of the finest Mediterranean cuisine served by its attentive and dynamic staff. The quality of its cuisine, location and friendly service means visitors will find Barcelona locals enjoying its terrace or indoor dining room with its sea views. The restaurant’s peaceful, pleasant terrace is one of its hidden gems. Located right on Barceloneta beach there are few pleasures that can match sampling and sharing an excellent paella right by the sea; or sipping a delicious cocktail in good company with the sound of the waves in the background. And at nightfall, in the moonlight, the terrace becomes the perfect setting.
