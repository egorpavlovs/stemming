                    DESCRIPTION
                    1952 saw the birth of a Barcelona icon, the Hotel Avenida Palace. This majestic, classic, welcoming hotel retains all the elegance of the 1950s and the original 1940s staircase which was built before it became a hotel. Located in the heart of the city, the hotel is surrounded by some of Gaudí?s most famous landmarks and the city?s most popular shopping and leisure districts, such as the Plaça de Catalunya, La Rambla and the Gothic Quarter. The hotel has 151 recently renovated guest rooms, including nine executive suites, 12 junior suites, one premium suite and the unique Beatles Suite. The hotel can host meetings for ten to 300 people in its six meeting rooms, where you?ll find a team of professional who will be ready to follow your instructions and coordinate every detail to guarantee your event is an absolute success.
