                    DESCRIPTION
                    Liceu Opera Barcelona, known simply as the Liceu, was founded in la Rambla de Barcelona in 1847. It is the largest Italian style opera theatre in Europe and the second largest in the world. With more than 160 years of uninterrupted activity behind it, the Liceu has been a privileged witness to some of the most crucial events in the nineteenth and twentieth century. It has become a social and cultural reference point for both Barcelona and Catalonia. Located in the historic centre of Barcelona and easy to reach from the main gateways into the city, the Liceu offers the most exclusive and glamorous spaces for any type of event. Equipped with the latest technology, its 4 main spaces guarantee success for any event.
