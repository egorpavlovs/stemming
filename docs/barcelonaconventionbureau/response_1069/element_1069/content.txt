                    DESCRIPTION
                    Surrounded by verdant scenery and vineyards, the Hotel Arrey Alella opened in June 2016. It has 37 guest rooms in four categories: single, standard double, superior double and deluxe double. They are all exterior and have views of the sea or mountains. Its restaurant and café *Can Balcells* opens early until late and offers a number of dining options depending on the time of day, from a set menu or some tapas to a carefully assembled menu of Mediterranean dishes featuring seasonal produce, accompanied by a handpicked list of wines and cavas from the area which is famed for its Designation of Origin: D.O. Alella. A magical culinary experience is guaranteed.Three function rooms and a beautiful cellar, which can be adapted for business meetings, presentations or courses, make the hotel the perfect combination of work and relaxation. A garden and outdoor swimming pool combine to ensure that this welcoming place becomes a little piece of paradise, whether you’re having a pre-meal drink, a snack from our poolside menu or just a coffee.
