                    DESCRIPTION
                    Lladró designs porcelain for the homes of the 21st century. This Spanish multinational and family business has made all its porcelain by hand in Valencia for more than 60 years. Its boutique in Barcelona is situated on Passeig de Gràcia, home to the best-known brands in the luxury sector. It is set in a space designed to bring to life the stories told by the Lladró creations in the unique language of porcelain. From the classic Lladró pieces in shiny porcelain and pastel colours to the works created in collaboration with top designers in the international arena, the Lladró Boutique offers a wealth of options for decoration and gifts. One example is the lithophane inspired by the city of Barcelona. When lit, the transparency of the porcelain brings out the hand-etched patterns. Warm and welcoming lights to provide an indelible memory of your visit to Barcelona.
