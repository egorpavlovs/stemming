Lima has a characteristic charm, a passage to Latin American history, cradle of the most imposing and majestic works of architectural art.
The Historic Center of Lima is the place of origin of the colonial city, where the main buildings and churches of the time are located. It was declared a World Heritage Site by Unesco in 1988 due to the importance that the city had during the Viceroyalty of Peru, leaving as a testimony of its great domain and history, architectural beauties, in which through its more than 1,600 balconies, 11 Casonas and Palaces of the Viceroyalty, and other buildings in the style of neoclassical art and Art Nouveau, reflects that through time is still worthy of contemplation.
The city is bathed by waters of the Pacific Ocean, so at the beginning of the XVIII century, it received the honorific title of “Pearl of the Pacific”, since it was the entrance of the international trade in our historic Port of Callao; which has one of the largest military monuments built in the virreinal era.
