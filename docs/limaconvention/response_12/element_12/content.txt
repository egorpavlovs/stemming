Lima is the capital city of Peru. It is located in the central coast of the country, on the shores of the Pacific Ocean, forming an extensive and populous urban area. It has a mild and fresh climate throughout the year, due to its proximity to the beaches and absence of rain.
The City of Kings, as it is known for its hierarchy and tradition, has an unique beauty that comes from the combination of its history, its customs, its culture and its people.
It is a modern city, full of places to discover, with an exquisite gastronomy, excellent infrastructure and great entertainment centers; for that reason, it is considered the main political, cultural, financial and commercial center of the country.
