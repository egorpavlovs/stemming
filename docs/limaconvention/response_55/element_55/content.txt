			Successful participation of the Bureau of Lima in IBTM Americas 2018
																		
		
			The trade fair specialized in the industry of meetings was held on September 5 and 6 in Mexico City and became more than 3,500 visitors, 1,000 buyers, 400 brands and 45 high-level speakers.
The Bureau of Conventions and Visitors of Lima was present for the third consecutive year organizing the presence of our destination in a stand with four co-exhibiting companies: Libertador Hotels, RLA SAV, Peru Specialist and Coltur.
It should be noted that this is the first edition in which IBTM America (previously held in the United States), integrates with the Latin American version, becoming the leading international trade fair for the meetings and events industry in North America, Latin America and Europe.
As a result of the participation, the Bureau of Lima successfully completed more than 45 business meetings with organizations and meeting planners from the Americas and Europe.
We thank the support of the Commercial Office of Peru in Mexico, its director Mrs. María Teresa Villena, for contributing to the success of our participation in the IBTM Americas and the Ambassador of Peru in Mexico Mr. Julio Garro Gálvez, for accompanying the delegation of the Peruvian in this momentous event for the meetings industry.
