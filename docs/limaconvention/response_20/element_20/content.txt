	Gastronomy
					
  
	 
Peruvian cuisine is a celebration of Peru, a country with a millenary tradition that doesn’t lose sight of its roots and where the art of good food stands out among its inhabitants.
Lima is known as the gastronomic capital of Latin America thanks to the amplitude and exquisiteness of dishes approved in a convincing way by the most prestigious chefs and specialists in the subject. The mixture of ingredients, our diversity of cultures and the multiple cooking techniques, modern and ancestral, have developed a unique culinary tradition in the world.
In recent years a culinary revolution has emerged with fusion food and Novo-Andean cuisine, in addition to the use of organic cocoa in the preparation of excellent chocolate desserts and the great diffusion of Peruvian coffee, of many varieties. Both cocoa and Peruvian coffee have won several international awards around the world.
Restaurants
The gastronomic scene of Lima is already a strong reason to visit the city. The Peruvian capital boasts a gastronomy of the highest level, with more than 800 categorized restaurants where you can immerse yourself in the fascinating cuisine of Peru. Miraflores, Barranco and San Isidro are the main gastronomic poles of Lima, with proposals ranging from sumptuous author’s dishes to simple and autochthonous elaborations.
Although the cebiche heads the list of Peruvian national dishes (which lists almost 500 dishes, a record in the world), Lima restaurants experiment with many other recipes and ingredients, combining tradition with the contemporary, the typical with the exotic. The renowned Peruvian cuisine is the result of a multicultural diversity that makes it unique (mix of indigenous cuisine, Creole, African, Chinese and Japanese), a diversity present in each of the culinary venues of the city. Whatever restaurant you choose, going out to eat in Lima is an incomparable experience.
