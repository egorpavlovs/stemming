			Lima and Cartagena sign agreement to increase the Tourism of Meetings
																		
		
			With the purpose of contributing to the increase in the number of events, meetings, fairs and incentive trips in their destinations, generating higher currencies and better level of knowledge in the two cities, the Convention and Visitors Bureau of Lima and the Bureau of Conventions and Visitors from Cartagena de Indias signed an institutional cooperation agreement on the 20th of this month in the city of Cartagena de Indias.
This cooperation establishes the exchange of information, leads or other means that can help cities in attracting events, as well as the exchange of information on events already carried out by both cities.
“This action will generate a synergy that will also share good professional and institutional practices for the development of the tourism industry of meetings in both destinations,” said the president of the Lima Bureau, Jorge León Benavides.
