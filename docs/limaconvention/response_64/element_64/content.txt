			Lima will host the 5th Latin-American Muscle-Skeletal Medicine Congress
																		
		
			The Bureau of Conventions and Visitors of Lima is pleased to inform that, following the mission of our institution to position the city of Lima as a destination of excellence for the realization of national and international events, it was possible for the Peruvian capital to host the 5th LATIN AMERICAN CONGRESS MUSCLE-SKELETAL MEDICINE.
In order to achieve this important achievement, a joint work was carried out with the Peruvian Association of Regenerative Medicine and Muscle-Skeletal Pain, who undertook the hard work of focusing efforts so that Lima could be victorious among the participating cities; Likewise, institutional support was obtained from the Commission for the Promotion of Peru for Exports and Tourism (PROMPERÚ).
It is necessary to mention that the realization of the event will benefit the entire community of professionals involved in comprehensive non-surgical treatments of musculoskeletal problems, enriching their knowledge and forming excellent specialists in the industry.
The Bureau of Conventions and Visitors of Lima reaffirms its commitment to continue working for the city so that Lima is a leading destination for meetings.
