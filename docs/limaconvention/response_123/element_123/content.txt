			We welcome our new President Jorge León Benavides!
																		
		
			It is important to note that the Convention Bureau of Lima is a private association whose main function is to promote the city of Lima as a destination for congresses and events. In this way, the businessman Jorge León Benavides will be in charge of putting the city of Lima in the eyes of the world regarding the investment of entrepreneurs. He is the new President of the Bureau of Conventions and Visitors of Lima for the period 2018-2020. “One of the objectives will be to attract congresses and events to the city of Lima, competing in this way with cities such as New York, Buenos Aires, Sao Paulo, among others,” said Jorge Benavides. “Lima continues to concentrate the development of the meetings industry, due to the hotel infrastructure, quality of services and tourist attractions,” said the Executive Chairman of the Digamma Group. He added that one of the points on the work agenda – as part of the activities heading to the Bicentennial of Peru – will be to place our country in the top positions worldwide as a destination for meetings and events.
