			Desalination, Reuse and Water Treatment
																		
		
			In the city of Lima, on the premises of the Radisson Decapolis Hotel – Miraflores, on August 7 and 8 of this year, the Latin American Association of Desalination and Water Reuse, ALADYR, will be holding the ALADYR Seminar “Desalination, Treatment and Reuse de Agua “- II Edition Peru, an event that has the support of internationally recognized companies such as Avista, Fluence, Lg Chem, PWT, Safbon, Veolia, Accuaproduct, Waters and Processes, Genesys, Dow, Toray, Seven Seas Water, others.
The seminar will address topics of interest and cutting edge in terms of desalination, treatment and water reuse and related, as well as success stories, technologies and projects under development. The lecture hall of international category speakers will be responsible for making this edition a reference for all related professionals.
In 2017 ALADYR held the first edition of the seminar in Peruvian lands, an event that brought together more than 100 attendees, all linked to companies in the sector. The success was notorious and with that came the commitment of each year to carry out this one in Lima, for this occasion it is estimated a total of 120 participants and an average of 100 different companies.
The seminar promotes the dissemination and exchange of experiences and knowledge in favor of the respectful and sustainable use of the invaluable resource “AGUA”, it is necessary to emphasize that ALADYR develops this type of events in different latitudes of Latin America, with the intention that options such as desalination , treatment and reuse of water and effluents are increasingly known and used in order to preserve this resource; considering that it is a vital element for humanity and its use is present in every industrial process; being necessary measures for its preservation and adequate valuation.
In this opportunity we will have among the speakers the National Water Authority with the theme “Water Use Rights, Authorizations of Residual Water Dumps”, Quimtia “Treatment of Effluents Cyanurated with the Combined Action of Chemical Physical Processes and Osmosis Membranes” , Energy Recovery “Energy Recovery in Reverse Osmosis Systems”, EDI “Conversion of Oxidation Lagoons to Advanced Activated Sludge Systems”, and Philippi Prieto Carrizosa Ferrero Du & Uría “Reuse of Waters in Peru – Normative Framework and Practical Application in Subject of APPs “, among other entities.
ALADYR extends the invitation to participate, ensuring that not only the valuable thematic agenda will be of benefit, but also the important commercial, academic and professional relationships that can be generated and enhanced through this meeting. Making a special call to the public authorities to join this initiative, for the editions held in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Colombia we had the participation of various ministries and entities of sanitation, potabilization and sewage; In Peru, government agencies have made important efforts for the preservation and measured use of the water resource at the domestic and industrial levels and this is an excellent way to continue with the task.
