[[File:DFB Pokal Viertelfinale 2008 FC Bayern - 1860 München 1.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Munich derby]] match at the Allianz Arena between Bayern and 1860 Munich in the quarter-final of the [[2007–08 DFB-Pokal]] on 27 February 2008]]

Bayern is one of three professional football clubs in [[Munich]]. Bayern's main local rival is [[TSV 1860 Munich|1860 Munich]], who was the more successful club in the 1960s, winning a cup and a championship. In the 1970s and 1980s, 1860 Munich moved between the first and the third division. The [[Munich derby]] is still a much-anticipated event, getting a lot of extra attention from supporters of both clubs.<ref>Bayern Magazin: Sonderheft DFB-Pokal, 27 February 2008 (in German)</ref> 1860 Munich is considered more working-class, and therefore suffers from a diminishing fan base in a city where the manufacturing sector is declining.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Bayern is considered the establishment club,<ref name="tsv1860">{{cite book | last = Schulze-Marmeling | first = Dietrich | title = Die Bayern.

Despite the rivalry, Bayern has repeatedly supported 1860 in times of financial disarray.<ref name="tsv1860"/>

[[Philipp Lahm]] said that playing Nürnberg is "always special" and is a "heated atmosphere".<ref name="Bavarian Derby"/> Both clubs played in the same league in the mid-1920s, but in the 1920s and 1930s, Nürnberg was far more successful, winning five [[German football champions|championships]] in the 1920s, making the club Germany's record champion. Bayern took over the title more than sixty years later, when they won their tenth championship in [[1986–87 Bundesliga|1987]], thereby surpassing the number of championships won by Nürnberg.<ref name="Bavarian Derby"/><ref>{{cite book | last = Schulze-Marmeling | first = Dietrich

Bayern also enjoys a strong rivalry with the [[1. FC Kaiserslautern]], originating in parts from a game in 1973, when Bayern lost 7–4 after leading 4–1,<ref>[http://www.weltfussball.de/spielbericht/bundesliga-1973-1974-1-fc-kaiserslautern-bayern-muenchen/ Bundesliga 1973/1974 » 12.

Since the 1970s, Bayern's main rivals have been the clubs who put up the strongest fight against its national dominance. In the 1970s this was [[Borussia Mönchengladbach]],<ref name = "bayernhistory6876"/> in the 1980s the category expanded to include [[Hamburger SV]].

They also have played against each other in the DFB-Pokal final in [[2008 DFB-Pokal Final|2008]], [[2012 DFB-Pokal Final|2012]], [[2014 DFB-Pokal Final|2014]], and [[2016 DFB-Pokal Final|2016]]. The 2–5 loss against Dortmund in the 2012 final was Bayern's worst ever loss in a DFB-Pokal final. Bayern and Dortmund have also played against each other in the DFL-Supercup in [[1989 DFB-Supercup|1989]], [[2012 DFL-Supercup|2012]], [[2013 DFL-Supercup|2013]], [[2014 DFL-Supercup|2014]], [[2016 DFL-Supercup|2016]], and [[2017 DFL-Supercup|2017]]. The height of the competition between the two clubs was when Bayern defeated Dortmund 2–1 in the [[2013 UEFA Champions League Final|final]] of the [[2012–13 UEFA Champions League]].

Due to Bayern being traditionally hard to beat for Madrid, Madrid supporters often refer to Bayern as the "''Bestia negra''" ("Black Beast"). Despite the number of duels, Bayern and Real have never met in the final of a Champions League or European Cup.
