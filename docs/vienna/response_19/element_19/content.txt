                Value Added Tax

                We have summarised the essentials regarding Value Added Tax (VAT) in connection with congresses.

                General factsAccording to EU VAT law, participation fees for  congresses and fairs are always taxable in the country where the  congress takes place. Congresses held in Austria and their participation  fees are subject to Austrian VAT legislation which stipulates that  these fees are, in general, subject to 20% VAT which need to be charged  to the participants and paid to the local Austrian tax authority.In  in order to make the payments to the authority it is necessary to  register with the Austrian tax authority, obtain an Austrian VAT-ID  number and file VAT returns in Austria.A significant part of the  costs that are incurred by the congress organiser in Austria will be  charged by the suppliers with Austrian VAT. The standard VAT rate in  Austria is 20% and applies, for example, to the rent of the congress  venue. Hotel room rates are subject to 10% Austrian VAT and  transportation services are subject to 10% Austrian VAT. The VAT rate  for catering services depends on the actual service (10% for food and  20% for drinks). This input VAT (i.e. VAT that is charged to the  organisation by its suppliers) is deductible according to the general  rules under Austrian VAT law.Income from sponsoring and the  rental of exhibition stands is usually seen as a service that falls  under the B2B general rule and is therefore taxable at the place where  the recipient has established its business (reverse charge).Special rules for charitable organisationsAustrian tax law has very attractive tax privileges for charitable organizations.Whether  or not an organisation is regarded as charitable organisation for  Austrian tax purposes has to be scrutinised under Austrian tax law only.  Given that the regulations concerning charitable organisations are not  harmonised within the European Union, the charitable status in another  EU member state may only be an indication but is not sufficient from an  Austrian tax perspective. The prerequisites for being tax exempt for  charitable organisations in Austria needs to be checked in detail on a  case-by-case basis.If an organisation is treated as a charitable organisation under Austrian tax law, it has the following options:The  organisation could opt to be treated as a non-entrepreneur in  connection with the congress in Austria so that no VAT would be payable.  Consequently, the organisation would not be allowed to deduct input  VAT, resulting in higher costs for the congress (i.e. rental of the  congress venue, catering, etc.).If the organisation opts to be  treated as an entrepreneur, it can apply the reduced VAT rate of 10% for  the participation fees. Input VAT can be fully deducted under the  general rules.In order to determine the most favourable option,  it is usually preferable to prepare a budget of the expected revenue and  costs of the congress.If the participation fees are dictated by  the market, the option to charge 10% VAT is usually more favourable (10%  VAT for participation fees would need to be paid to the tax authority  whereas usually 20% input VAT for services received can be reclaimed).Both  for registering an organisation for VAT purposes in Austria as well as  checking the charitable status (if applicable), professional tax advice  is highly recommended. It is not possible under Austrian tax law to not  register for VAT purposes without a detailed check of a possible  charitable status of an organisation. If Austrian taxes are not  correctly paid, the legal representatives of the organisation may be  held personally liable and subject to severe penalties under the  Austrian Fiscal Penalty Law.If required, you can use the services of a specialised Austrian tax accountant such as:Deloitte Wien Mr. Christoph Hofer	chhofer@deloitte.at http://www.deloitte.atTPA HorwathMs. Veronika Seitwegerveronika.seitweger@tpa-horwath.comhttp://www.tpa-horwath.com
