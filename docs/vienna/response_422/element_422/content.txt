        International Vienna

        

        For the employees of international companies working abroad (expatriates), Vienna is the most livable city in the world. The Mercer Study, which surveys expatriates around the world and voted the city into first place in 2018 for the ninth year in a row. And in 2018, for the first, the renowned British news magazine “The Economist” chose Vienna as the word's most livable city, the first European city ever to hold this title. This explains why international organizations and leading global corporations feel so at home here. However, Vienna's global significance does not stop at being a HeadquarterCity: it also impresses as a KnowledgeCity, a CongressCity and a "DiverCity". And each of these functions is signaled visually by a striking landmark.

        International Vienna downloadFor example, Vienna's Donau City, which is home to major global corporations as well as numerous UN organizations, is considered the heart of the HeadquarterCity. The United Nations has defined Vienna as one of its four official seats and is represented here with 15 of its organizations. OPEC (Petroleum Exporting Countries) and the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) also have their headquarters in the city. In total, international organizations employ over 6,000 people. More than 200 multinational corporations, including JVC, Hewlett-Packard, Henkel, Beiersdorf and Boehringer Ingelheim take advantage of Vienna as an ideal location for servicing Central and Eastern Europe. Illustrious Austrian companies such as Wienerberger AG and OMV have also selected Vienna for the head offices of their groups.The city’s high quality of life and safety are reasons why international companies and organizations choose Vienna as a location to do business. The multinational flair contributes to Vienna being highly regarded around the world by congress organizers and participants alike. More than 4,000 congresses and corporate events, which generated a total of 1.874 million overnight stays in 2017 alone, speak as clearly as the ranking of the ICCA (International Congress and Convention Association). In 2017, Vienna came in second place alongside Paris. In addition to good accessibility and top services for event organizers, CongressCity Wien provides attractive event venues such as the Hofburg Vienna, the Austria Center Vienna and Messe Wien. Vienna's importance as a city of knowledge is another motive for many organizers to bring their conference to Vienna. With a research ratio of 3.66%, Vienna is one of the leading regions in the EU. Around 46,000 people are employed in the area of research and development. The number of research companies in the city has grown by over 300%(!) since 2000. And with around 200,000 students, Vienna is the biggest university city in the German-speaking countries - with more students than Berlin or Munich. The new campus of the Vienna University of Economics and Business gives the Knowledge City of Vienna significant impulses and enriches locations such as the developing Neu Marx Research and Technology  Center, the campus of Vienna University and Siemens City with a further knowledge hub. The international character of the city is based on its openness to the world – which in turn finds its foothold in the multicultural composition of Vienna's population. A walk through one of Vienna's markets, such as Naschmarkt, illustrates this as clearly as a look at traditional Viennese cuisine, which encompasses dishes originating from all the countries of the former Danube monarchy and offers delicious proof of the city's cultural diversity. DiverCity Vienna is currently a home and place of employment for people from all parts of the world, around one third of Viennese were born outside Austria and almost half of the 1.9 million residents have a "migrant background" - in other words, either they themselves were born outside of Austria or have at least one parent who was born elsewhere.Facts and Figures "International Vienna"HeadquarterCityVienna is one of the four official seats of the United Nations and home to 15 UN organizations, IAEA and OPEC, OSZE (seat of the secretariat in Vienna since 1995) as well as numerous other international organizations – with around 6,000 employees211 international corporations have headquarters in Vienna (incl.
