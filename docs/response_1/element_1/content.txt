{{main|History of FC Bayern Munich}}

===Early years (1900–1965)===
[[File:Fcn-fcb1901.jpg|thumb|right|The first game of FC Bayern Munich against [[1. FC Nürnberg]] in 1901]]
FC Bayern Munich was founded by members of a Munich gymnastics club (MTV 1879). When a congregation of members of MTV 1879 decided on 27 February 1900 that the footballers of the club would not be allowed to join the [[German Football Association]] (DFB), 11 members of the football division left the congregation and on the same evening founded Fußball-Club Bayern München. Within a few months, Bayern achieved high-scoring victories against all local rivals, including a 15–0 win against FC Nordstern,<ref>{{cite news|title=Bayern fans bring club's earliest years to light|url=http://www.thelocal.de/20150522/fc-bayern-fans-early-history-rediscovered|accessdate=30 May 2015|publisher=The Local|date=22 May 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150525162232/http://www.thelocal.de/20150522/fc-bayern-fans-early-history-rediscovered|archivedate=25 May 2015}}</ref> and reached the semi-finals of the 1900–01 [[Southern German football championship|South German championship]].<ref name="fcbbook1stch"/> In the following years, the club won some local trophies and in 1910–11 Bayern joined the newly founded "Kreisliga", the first regional Bavarian league. The club won this league in its first year, but did not win it again until the beginning of [[World War I]] in 1914, which halted all football activities in Germany.<ref name = "bayernhistory0045"/><ref>{{cite book | last = Schulze-Marmeling | first = Dietrich | title = Die Bayern. Die Geschichte des deutschen Rekordmeisters | language = German | publisher = Die Werkstatt | year = 2003 | pages = 30–40 | isbn = 3-89533-426-X}}</ref> By the end of its first decade of founding, FC Bayern had attracted its first German national team player, Max ''Gaberl'' Gablonsky.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fcbayern.com/de/club/historie/meilensteine-seit-1900/1900-bis-1932-von-beginn-an-erfolgreich|title=Von Beginn an erfolgreich|last=Kwolek|first=Sarah-Luisa|date=13 July 2016|website=FC Bayern München|language=de|access-date=3 February 2019}}</ref> By 1920, it had over 700 members, making it the largest football club in Munich.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fcbayern.com/de/club/historie/meilensteine-seit-1900/1900-bis-1932-von-beginn-an-erfolgreich|title=Von Beginn an erfolgreich|last=Kwolek|first=Sarah-Luisa|date=13 July 2016|website=FC Bayern München|language=de|access-date=3 February 2019}}</ref> 

In the years after the war, Bayern won several regional competitions before winning its first South German championship in 1926, an achievement repeated two years later.<ref name = "bayernhistory0045" /><ref>{{cite book | last = Schulze-Marmeling | first = Dietrich | title = Die Bayern. Die Geschichte des deutschen Rekordmeisters | language = German | publisher = Die Werkstatt | year = 2003 | pages = 51–63 | isbn = 3-89533-426-X}}</ref> Its first national title was gained in [[German football championship 1932|1932]], when coach [[Richard Kohn|Richard "Little Dombi" Kohn]] led the team to the [[German champions (football)|German championship]] by defeating [[Eintracht Frankfurt]] 2–0 in the final.<ref name = "bayernhistory0045" />

The advent of [[Nazism]] put an abrupt end to Bayern's development. Club president [[Kurt Landauer]] and the coach, both of whom were Jewish, left the country. Many others in the club were also purged. Bayern was taunted as the "[[Judenklub|Jew's club]]", while local rival [[TSV 1860 Munich|1860 Munich]] gained much support. Josef Sauter, who was inaugurated 1943, was the only NSDAP member as president. As some Bayern players greeted Landauer, who was watching a friendly in Switzerland lead to continued discrimination.<ref name="landauer">{{cite web | url = http://www.zeit.de/2003/23/Sport_2flandauer/komplettansicht | title = Onkel Kurt und die Bayern | language = de | publisher = Zeit Online | date = 28 May 2003 | accessdate = 16 October 2014 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141017200655/http://www.zeit.de/2003/23/Sport_2flandauer/komplettansicht | archivedate = 17 October 2014 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> Bayern was also affected by the ruling that football players had to be full amateurs again. In the following years, Bayern could not sustain its role of contender for the national title, achieving mid-table results in its regional league instead.<ref>{{cite book | last = Schulze-Marmeling | first = Dietrich | title = Die Bayern. Die Geschichte des deutschen Rekordmeisters | language = German | publisher = Die Werkstatt | year = 2003 | pages = 101–2 | isbn = 3-89533-426-X}}</ref>

After the war, Bayern became a member of the [[Oberliga Süd (1945–63)|Oberliga Süd]], the southern conference of the German first division, which was split five ways at that time. Bayern struggled, hiring and firing 13 coaches between 1945 and 1963. Landauer returned from exile in 1947 and was once again appointed club president, the tenure lasted until 1951. He remains as the club's president with the longest accumulated tenure. Landauer has been deemed as inventor of Bayern as a professional club and his memory is being upheld by the Bayern [[ultras]] ''Schickeria''.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.br.de/fernsehen/bayerisches-fernsehen/sendungen/kurt-landauer-der-film/index.html | title = Kurt Landauer: Der Mann, der den FC Bayern erfand | language = de | publisher = [[Bayerischer Rundfunk]] | accessdate = 16 October 2014 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141015172638/http://www.br.de/fernsehen/bayerisches-fernsehen/sendungen/kurt-landauer-der-film/index.html | archivedate = 15 October 2014 | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.spiegel.de/sport/fussball/fc-bayern-muenchen-schickeria-ultras-erhalten-julius-hirsch-preis-a-997151.html | title = DFB-Auszeichnung: Bayern-Ultras erhalten Julius-Hirsch-Preis | language = de | publisher = Spiegel Online | date = 14 October 2014 | accessdate = 16 October 2014 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141018005832/http://www.spiegel.de/sport/fussball/fc-bayern-muenchen-schickeria-ultras-erhalten-julius-hirsch-preis-a-997151.html | archivedate = 18 October 2014 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> In 1955, the club was relegated but returned to the ''Oberliga'' in the following season and won the [[DFB-Pokal]] for the first time, beating [[Fortuna Düsseldorf]] 1–0 in the [[DFB-Pokal 1956–57#Final|final]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Schulze-Marmeling | first = Dietrich | title = Die Bayern.

Five teams from the Oberliga South were admitted. Bayern finished third in that year's southern division, but another Munich team, 1860 Munich, had won the championship. As the DFB preferred not to include two teams from one city, Bayern was not chosen for the Bundesliga.<ref name="nobl"/> They gained promotion two years later, fielding a team with young talents like [[Franz Beckenbauer]], [[Gerd Müller]] and [[Sepp Maier]]&nbsp;— who would later be collectively referred to as ''the axis''.<ref name = "bayernhistory4667" />

===The golden years (1965–1979)===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-N1108-304, Fußball-Europapokalspiel, Magdeburg - München.jpg|thumb|left|FC Bayern Munich against 1. FC Magdeburg in 1974]]
In their first Bundesliga [[1965–66 Bundesliga|season]], Bayern finished third and also won the [[DFB-Pokal 1965–66|DFB-Pokal]]. This qualified them for the following year's [[1966–67 European Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]], which they won in a dramatic [[1967 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|final]] against Scottish club [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], when [[Franz Roth]] scored the decider in a 1–0 [[Overtime (sports)|extra time]] victory.<ref name = "bayernhistory4667" /> In 1967, Bayern retained the [[DFB-Pokal 1966–67|DFB-Pokal]], but slow overall progress saw [[Branko Zebec]] take over as coach. He replaced Bayern's offensive style of play with a more disciplined approach, and in doing so achieved the first [[1968–69 Bundesliga|league]] and [[1968–69 DFB-Pokal|cup]] [[Double (association football)|double]] in Bundesliga history in 1969. Bayern Munich are one of four German clubs to win the Bundesliga and DFB-Pokal in the same season along with [[Borussia Dortmund]], [[1. FC Köln]] and [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]]. Zebec used only 13 players throughout [[1968–69 FC Bayern Munich season|the season]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Schulze-Marmeling | first = Dietrich | title = Die Bayern.

[[Udo Lattek]] took charge in 1970. After winning the [[DFB-Pokal 1970–71|DFB-Pokal]] in [[1970–71 FC Bayern Munich season|his first season]], Lattek led Bayern to their [[1971–72 Bundesliga|third German championship]]. The deciding match in the [[1971–72 FC Bayern Munich season|1971–72]] season against [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]] was the first match in the new [[Olympiastadion (Munich)|Olympiastadion]], and was also the first live televised match in Bundesliga history.

===From FC Breitnigge to FC Hollywood (1979–1998)===
The 1980s were a period of off-field turmoil for Bayern, with many changes in personnel and financial problems. On the field, [[Paul Breitner]] and [[Karl-Heinz Rummenigge]], termed ''FC Breitnigge'', led the team to Bundesliga titles in [[1979–80 Bundesliga|1980]] and [[1980–81 Bundesliga|1981]]. Apart from a DFB-Pokal win in [[1981–82 DFB-Pokal|1982]], two relatively unsuccessful seasons followed, after which Breitner retired and former coach Udo Lattek returned. Bayern won the DFB-Pokal in [[DFB-Pokal 1983–84|1984]] and went on to win five Bundesliga championships in six seasons, including a [[Double (association football)|double]] in [[1985–86 FC Bayern Munich season|1986]]. European success, however, was elusive during the decade; Bayern managed to claim the runners-up spot in the European Cup in [[1981–82 European Cup|1982]] and [[1986–87 European Cup|1987]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Schulze-Marmeling | first = Dietrich | title = Die Bayern.

[[Jupp Heynckes]] was hired as coach in 1987, but after two consecutive championships in [[1988–89 Bundesliga|1988–89]] and [[1989–90 Bundesliga|1989–90]], Bayern's form dipped. After finishing second in [[1990–91 Bundesliga|1990–91]], the club finished just five points above the relegation places in [[1991–92 Bundesliga|1991–92]]. In [[1993–94 FC Bayern Munich season|1993–94]], Bayern was eliminated in the [[1993–94 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] second round to [[Premier League]] side [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], who remain the only English club to beat Bayern at the Olympiastadion. Success returned when Franz Beckenbauer took over for the second half of the 1993–94 season, winning the [[1993–94 Bundesliga|championship]] again after a four-year gap. Beckenbauer was then appointed club president.<ref>{{cite book | last = Schulze-Marmeling | first = Dietrich | title = Die Bayern.

Hitzfeld returned as a trainer in January 2007, but Bayern finished the [[2006–07 Bundesliga|2006–07 season]] in fourth position, thus failing to qualify for the [[2007–08 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] for the first time in more than a decade.

After almost a year of investigations against Uli Hoeneß, Bayern's former player, former long-time general manager, and president at the time, he was convicted of tax evasion on 13 March 2014. Hoeneß resigned as president the next day, and Karl Hopfner was elected president on 2 May. Just days after Hoeneß conviction, on 25 March, Bayern won their 24th [[2013–14 Bundesliga|Bundesliga]] title by beating Hertha BSC 3–1 at the [[Olympiastadion (Berlin)|Olympiastadion]] in [[Berlin]]. With seven matches remaining in the season, it was the earliest the championship had been won in Bundesliga history, breaking the record Bayern had set in the previous season.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/25/bayern-munich-win-bundesliga-title|title=Bayern Munich wrap up Bundesliga title with seven games to spare|date=26 March 2014|work=The Guardian|accessdate=26 March 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326030005/http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/25/bayern-munich-win-bundesliga-title|archivedate=26 March 2014}}</ref> At the end of the season Bayern beat Borussia Dortmund 2–0 in the [[2014 DFB-Pokal Final]] to give the club the tenth league and cup double in its history.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2014/05/17/bayern-beats-dortmund-2-0-in-german-cup-final/9221529/|title=Bayern beats Dortmund 2–0 in German Cup final|date=17 May 2014|accessdate=18 May 2014|work=USA Today|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140518034214/http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2014/05/17/bayern-beats-dortmund-2-0-in-german-cup-final/9221529/|archivedate=18 May 2014}}</ref> In [[2014–15 FC Bayern Munich season|2014–15]], Bayern defended their [[2015–16 Bundesliga|league]] title, and, the following season, won an 11th double, including a record fourth consecutive Bundesliga title.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/36211832|title=Bayern Munich 0–0 Borussia Dortmund|date=21 May 2016|work=BBC|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005220836/http://www.bbc.com/sport/football/36211832|archivedate=5 October 2017}}</ref> At the end of the [[2015–16 FC Bayern Munich season|2015–16]] season, Guardiola left Bayern to take over as manager of [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and was replaced by [[Carlo Ancelotti]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11890/10105921/bayern-munich-confirm-carlo-ancelotti-will-replace-pep-guardiola|title=Bayern Munich confirm Carlo Ancelotti will replace Pep Guardiola|date=20 December 2015|work=Sky Sports|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160524174457/http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11890/10105921/bayern-munich-confirm-carlo-ancelotti-will-replace-pep-guardiola|archivedate=24 May 2016}}</ref>

On 9 October 2017, Jupp Heynckes returned for the fourth time to manage Bayern. Heynckes signed a contract until the end of the 2017–18 season. Bayern finished the 2017–18 season as Bundesliga champions for the sixth consecutive season, finishing 21 points ahead of second-place Schalke 04. Heynckes retired from professional football, aged 73.

After it became clear that Heynckes would not continue as head coach, the club began a long and extensive search for a replacement. It was initially rumored that [[Thomas Tuchel]], former coach of Borussia Dortmund, would take over, but he signed a contract with Paris Saint-Germain, in turn ending all speculation. On 1 July 2018, the former Bayern Munich player [[Niko Kovač]] was officially confirmed as the next head coach, signing a three-year deal.<ref>{{cite web |title=Eintracht Frankfurt's Niko Kovac to succeed Jupp Heynckes as Bayern Munich head coach |url=https://www.bundesliga.com/en/news/Bundesliga/niko-kovac-to-succeed-jupp-heynckes-as-bayern-munich-coach-478173.jsp |website=Bundesliga.com |accessdate=3 February 2019}}</ref>

In the original club constitution, Bayern's colours were named as white and blue, but the club played in white shirts with black shorts until 1905, when Bayern joined MSC. MSC decreed that the footballers would have to play in red shorts. Also, the younger players were called red shorts, which was meant as an insult.<ref name="fcbbook1stch"/> For most of the club's early history, Bayern had primarily worn white and maroon home kits. In [[1968–69 FC Bayern Munich season|1968–69 season]], Bayern changed to red and blue striped shirts, with blue shorts and socks. Between 1969 and 1973, the team wore a home strip of red and white striped shirts with either red or white shorts and red socks. In the [[1973–74 FC Bayern Munich season|1973–74 season]], the team switched to an all-white kit featuring single vertical red and blue stripes on the shirt. From 1974 onwards, Bayern has mostly worn an all red home kit, with white trim. Bayern revived the red and blue striped colour scheme between 1995 and 1997. In 1997, blue was the dominant colour for the first time when Adidas released an all navy blue home kit with a red chest band. In 1999, Bayern returned to a predominantly red kit, which featured blue sleeves, and in 2000 the club released a traditional all red kit with white trim to be worn for Champions League matches.<ref name="crestcolor"/> Bayern also wore a ''Rotwein'' coloured home kits in Bundesliga matches between 2001 and 2003, and during the [[2006–07 UEFA Champions League|2006–07 Champions League]] campaign, in reference to their first choice colours prior to the late 1960s.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.stickerfreak.de/FC%20Bayern%20Seiten/Trikot%20Historie%20FCB.html|title=Die vollständige Trikot-Historie des FC Bayern München|accessdate=12 May 2014|language=German|work=stickerfreak|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131127161503/http://stickerfreak.de/FC%20Bayern%20Seiten/Trikot%20Historie%20FCB.html|archivedate=27 November 2013}}</ref>

The club's away kit has had a wide range of colours over the years, including white, black, blue, and gold-green. Bayern also features a distinct international kit. During the [[2013–14 FC Bayern Munich season|2013–14 season]], Bayern used an all red home kit with a [[Flag of Bavaria|Bavarian flag]] diamond watermark pattern, a ''[[Lederhosen]]'' inspired white and black ''[[Oktoberfest]]'' away kit, and an all navy blue international kit.<ref>{{cite news|title=Beer-ern Munich: European Champs Get Oktoberfest Uniforms|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/bayern-munich-stars-to-wear-lederhosen-inspired-shirts-a-919856.html|date=2 September 2013|accessdate=10 May 2014|work=Der Spiegel|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328111852/http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/bayern-munich-stars-to-wear-lederhosen-inspired-shirts-a-919856.html|archivedate=28 March 2014}}</ref>

In the 1980s and 1990s, Bayern used a special away kit when playing at [[1. FC Kaiserslautern]], representing the [[Brazil national football team|Brazilian]] colours blue and yellow, a [[superstition]] borne from the fact that the club found it hard to win there.<ref>[http://www.weltfussball.de/teams/bayern-muenchen/1-fc-kaiserslautern/11/ 1.

==Crest==
Bayern's crest has changed several times. Originally it consisted of the stylised letters F, C, B, M, which were woven into one symbol. The original crest was blue. The colours of [[Bavaria]] were included for the first time in 1954.<ref name="crestcolor"/> The crest from 1906 to 1919 denotes "Bayern FA", whereby "FA" stands for ''Fußball-Abteilung'', i.e. Football Department; Bayern then was integrated into TSV Jahn Munich and constituted its football department.

The modern version of the crest has changed from the 1954 version in several steps.<ref name="crestcolor"/> While the crest consisted of a single colour only for most of the time, namely blue or red, the current crest is blue, red, and white. It has the colours of Bavaria in its centre and FC Bayern München is written in white on a red ring enclosing the Bavarian colours.

==Stadiums==
[[File:Model of stadium at Leopoldstrasse.JPG|thumb|Model of Bayern's first stadium, their home from 1906 to 1924]]

Bayern played its first training games at the Schyrenplatz in the centre of [[Munich]]. The first official games were held on the [[Theresienwiese]]. In 1901, Bayern moved to a field of its own, located in [[Schwabing]] at the [[Clemensstraße]]. After joining the Münchner Sport-Club (MSC) in 1906, Bayern moved in May 1907 to MSC's ground at the Leopoldstraße.<ref>{{cite book

Many people, however, began to feel that the stadium was too cold in winter, with half the audience exposed to the weather due to lack of cover. A further complaint was the distance between the spectators and the pitch, betraying the stadium's track and field heritage. Renovation proved impossible, as the architect [[Günther Behnisch]] vetoed major modifications of the stadium.<ref name = "diebayern_allianzarena">{{cite book

[[File:Allianz arena at night Richard Bartz.jpg|thumb|[[Allianz Arena]] is lit in red for Bayern home games]]

After much discussion, the city of Munich, the state of [[Bavaria]], Bayern Munich and [[TSV 1860 Munich|1860 Munich]] jointly decided at the end of 2000 to build a new stadium. While Bayern had wanted a purpose-built football stadium for several years, the awarding of the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] to Germany stimulated the discussion as the Olympiastadion no longer met the [[FIFA]] criteria to host a World Cup game. Located on the northern outskirts of Munich, the [[Allianz Arena]] has been in use since the beginning of the [[2005–06 Bundesliga|2005–06]] season.<ref name = "diebayern_allianzarena" /> Its initial capacity of 66,000 fully covered seats has since been increased for matches on national level to 69,901 by transforming 3,000 seats to terracing in a 2:1 ratio.<ref>{{cite web | title = General information about the Allianz Arena | accessdate = 12 July 2008 | year = 2007 | publisher = Allianz Arena München Stadion GmbH | url = http://www.allianz-arena.de/en/fakten/allgemeine-informationen/ | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080529011548/http://www.allianz-arena.de/en/fakten/allgemeine-informationen/ | archivedate = 29 May 2008 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> Since August 2012, 2,000 more seats were added in the last row of the top tier increasing the capacity to 71,000.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fcbayern.de/de/news/news/2012/36638.php | title = Zuschauer-Kapazität der Allianz Arena erhöht | trans-title = Allianz Arena capacity increased | publisher = FC Bayern Munich | date = 29 August 2012 | language = de | accessdate = 28 September 2014 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141109065800/http://www.fcbayern.de/de/news/news/2012/36638.php | archivedate = 9 November 2014 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> In January 2015, a proposal to increase the capacity was approved by the city council so now Allianz Arena has a capacity of 75,000 (70,000 in Champions League).<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fcbayern.de/de/news/news/2015/ab-sofort-75-000-fans-bei-bundesliga-heimspielen-genehmigung-130115.php | title = AB SOFORT 75.000 FANS BEI BUNDESLIGA-HEIMSPIELEN | trans-title = From now 75000 fans at the Bundesliga games | publisher = FC Bayern Munich | date = 13 January 2015 | language = de | accessdate = 13 January 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150113190119/http://www.fcbayern.de/de/news/news/2015/ab-sofort-75-000-fans-bei-bundesliga-heimspielen-genehmigung-130115.php | archivedate = 13 January 2015 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>

The players' quarters opened in 1990 and were reconstructed after the 2007–08 season on suggestions by then new coach, [[Jürgen Klinsmann]], who took inspiration from various major sports clubs. The quarters are now called the performance centre and feature a weights and fitness area, a massage unit, dressing rooms, the coaches' office, and a conference room with screening facilities for video analysis. A café, a library, an [[e-Learning]] room, and a family room are also included.

Until August 2017 the Youth House was located at the headquarters at Säbener Straße. The Youth House housed up to 14 young talents aged from 15–18 years old from outside of Munich. Former residents of the Youth House include [[Bastian Schweinsteiger]], [[David Alaba]], [[Owen Hargreaves]], [[Michael Rensing]], [[Holger Badstuber]] and [[Emre Can]].

In 2006 Bayern purchased land near the Allianz Arena with the purpose of building a new youth academy. In 2015 the project, estimated to cost €70 million, was started, after overcoming internal resistance. The main reasons for the project were that the existing facilities were too small and that the club, while very successful at senior level, lacked competitiveness with other German and European clubs at youth level. The new facility is scheduled to open in the 2017–18 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/sport/fussball/fc-bayern-muenchen-legt-grundstein-fuer-neues-nachwuchszentrum-a-1058264.html|title=Neues Nachwuchsleistungszentrum|date=17 October 2015|website=spiegel.de|publisher=[[Der Spiegel]]|access-date=17 May 2016|language=German|trans-title=New youth academy|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529103652/http://www.spiegel.de/sport/fussball/fc-bayern-muenchen-legt-grundstein-fuer-neues-nachwuchszentrum-a-1058264.html|archivedate=29 May 2016}}</ref> On 21 August 2017 the [[FC Bayern Campus]] opened at a cost of €70 million.

===Coaches since 1963===
Bayern had 19 coaches since its promotion to the Bundesliga in 1965. [[Udo Lattek]], [[Giovanni Trapattoni]] and [[Ottmar Hitzfeld]] served two terms as head coach. [[Franz Beckenbauer]] served one term as head coach and one as caretaker, while [[Jupp Heynckes]] had four separate spells as manager, including one as caretaker manager.<ref>{{cite book | last = Schulze-Marmeling | first = Dietrich | title = Die Bayern. Die Geschichte des deutschen Rekordmeisters | language = German | publisher = Die Werkstatt | year = 2003 | page = 595 | isbn = 3-89533-426-X}}</ref> Lattek was the club's most successful coach, having won six Bundesliga titles, two DFB Cups and the European Cup; following closely is Ottmar Hitzfeld, who won five Bundesliga titles, two DFB cups and the Champions League. The club's least successful coach was [[Søren Lerby]], who won less than a third of his matches in charge and presided over the club's near-relegation in the 1991–92 campaign.

On 6 October 2017, Bayern announced the appointment of [[Jupp Heynckes]] as manager, his fourth stint with the club. Heynckes replaced [[Willy Sagnol]], who had taken charge following the sacking of [[Carlo Ancelotti]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Jupp Heynckes: Bayern Munich appoint ex-boss until end of the season|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/41517171|accessdate=6 October 2017|publisher=BBC Sport|date=6 October 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007014424/http://www.bbc.com/sport/football/41517171|archivedate=7 October 2017}}</ref> [[Niko Kovač]] is schedulued to succeed Heynckes as manager on 1 July 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bundesliga.com/en/news/Bundesliga/niko-kovac-to-succeed-jupp-heynckes-as-bayern-munich-coach-478173.jsp|title=Eintracht Frankfurt's Niko Kovac to succeed Jupp Heynckes as Bayern Munich head coach - bundesliga.com|website=bundesliga.com – the official Bundesliga website|accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref>

===Defunct===
====Baseball====
The baseball division existed during the 1960s and 1970s, during which the team won two German championships, in 1962 and 1969.

====Ice hockey====
From 1966 to 1969 there existed an [[ice hockey]] team, which completed two seasons in the [[Eishockey-Bundesliga]].

In the summer of 1965 the [[Münchner Eislauf Verein]] negotiated with Bayern Munich about joining the club. Although the talks came to nothing the ice hockey department of Münchner Eislauf Verein decided to join Bayern –mid-season– in January 1966. The team finished the season under the name of Bayern Munich in third place of the second-tier [[Oberliga (ice hockey)|Oberliga]]. The following season Bayern achieved promotion to the [[Eishockey-Bundesliga|Bundesliga]] where the club stayed for two seasons. However, in 1969 the club disbanded the department and sold the hockey team to [[Augsburger EV]], citing lack of local support and difficulty in recruiting players as reasons.<ref>51 Das Bayern Magazin: 2/2019, pages: 106–109, February 2019 (in German)</ref>

====Gymnastics====
The gymnastics department was founded in 1974 and were most successful in the 1980s. During this time, the team won four German championships in 1983, 1986, 1987, and 1988. In 2014, the division was dissolved.
