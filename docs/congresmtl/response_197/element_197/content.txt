It promotes your field and contributes to its advancement given the significant intellectual benefits that result from a convention.
Playing a role in moving your field forward.
Participating in Montréal’s scientific development.
The experience is professionally enriching and broadens your network.
It fosters the sharing of knowledge and best practices.
Lending your name to a major convention is a legacy that lasts a long time.

Play an active role in promoting Montréal as an international host city and invite your peers to discover it. We work together as a team to make it happen.
Putting together and shepherding a major international event takes work. We cannot, however, deny the payback on so many levels: personal reputation, recognition from your peers, the positive fallout for your company or university, not to mention having the international spotlight shine on your field and Montréal.Dr. Jacques Corcos
Emeritus Ambassador
Annual Meeting of the International Continence Society
