    Taking part in securing an international convention can change a career! In addition to being recently appointed Ambassador for his role in bringing the imposing Apimondia 2019 Apicultural Congress to Montréal, Pierre Giovenazzo is now Université Laval’s new leadership chair of apiculture science education. The chair will promote and support the teaching of apiculture science and training programs to help beekeepers run more productive and profitable operations, and consequently sustain the continuity of the beekeeping industry.
Given the numerous challenges the beekeeping industry is now facing, the chair will help the industry grow by contributing to the process of upgrading skills and knowledge, and improving how apiculture science is taught at the university level. There is growing demand in North America for honey bee pollination, and many farmers and producers depend on it to stay in business (including Québec’s blueberry and cranberry growers). On the other hand, honey bee colonies are feeling the effects of the many pesticides being used to treat crops, resulting in colony losses in Canada averaging 25% in winter and 20% in summer over the last decade. We have a shortage of apiculture science experts, and Québec will look to greatly benefit from how the research and education in this field is being structured at the university level.
Mr. Giovenazzo has been involved in apiculture research for over 15 years, on projects ranging from genetic selection, reproduction and diet to breeding and diseases. He teaches graduate courses, is the vice-president of the Canadian Association of Professional Apiculturists, chairs the organizing committee of Apimondia 2019, an event that will attract 6,500 delegates to Montréal, and is also a member of numerous Québec, Canadian and international beekeeping organizations.
