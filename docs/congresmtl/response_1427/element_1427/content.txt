    The Palais des congrès de Montréal has assembled a group of leaders representing eight of the city’s key economic sectors to form a new Multisector Strategic Taskforce. Their mission will be to establish ties with influencers who will actively contribute to attracting major international conferences to Montréal and the Palais des congrès.
Among the members sitting on this prestigious taskforce are:







Louise M. Benoît, president of Aéro Montréal
Frank Béraud, Chief Executive Officer of Montréal InVivo






Mathieu Charbonneau, Executive Director of CargoM
James J. Clark, Professor at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of McGill University






Fabrice Labeau, Interim Deputy Provost, Student Life and Learning, at McGill University
Marie Larue, Chief Executive Officer of the Institut de recherche Robert-Sauvé en santé et en sécurité du travail






Maryse Lassonde, Scientific Director of the Fonds de recherche du Québec – Nature et technologies
Serge Marchand, Scientific Director of the Fonds de recherche du Québec – Santé






Louise Poissant, Scientific Director of the Fonds de recherche du Québec – Société et culture
Gilles Savard, Chief Executive Officer of IVADO



 
The role of the vastly experienced leaders who make up the new Multisector Strategic Taskforce will be to develop and nurture ties with researchers, scientists and business executives who might be inclined to actively participate in the process of bringing large-scale international gatherings to Montréal. They will be able to mine their networks for topnotch collaborators and match them with specific conferences.
Conferences advance science
Montréal is widely recognized as a knowledge hub. The city attracts international conferences that enable local researchers and experts to interact with peers who have travelled here from every continent. The Palais des congrès de Montréal works very closely with its Ambassadors and partners to advocate for the major sectors driving the Montréal and Québec economy.
