Robert Mercure assumed his new position as President and CEO of the Palais on September 4. A well-known figure in the international tourism community, Mr. Mercure has extensive experience in the hospitality industry.
“It is with great pleasure that I return to Montréal after 11 years at the helm of a Québec crown jewel, the Château Frontenac. First and foremost, let me say that I absolutely love Montréal and its energy. Our city is known for its joie de vivre and as a place where any idea can spark something big to be added to an already rich slate of events, exhibitions and festivals. Montréal is a city of opportunities, and we are fortunate to be able to count on the creativity and drive of passionate people like you to make it such an exciting spot.
I come to the Palais with a headful of new ideas. As you know, the exhibition market is in the midst of a transformation, and staking your claim now requires the ability to generate surprise, think outside the box, and provide visitors with a genuine experience. Let’s be bold together! Our seasoned staff is eager to hear your daring ideas, and they will work alongside you doing everything they can to make them happen. Creativity is a gem that helps events grow, and we are ready to contribute to your success.”
