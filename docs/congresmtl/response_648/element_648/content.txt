				Palais des congrès de Montréal posts historic performancePositive annual results for Montréal business tourism leader
				May 29, 2018
			
			
			Positive annual results for Montréal business tourism leader
The Palais des congrès de Montréal had a very busy year, hosting 360 events, and coming really close to equalling its best record ever. It’s an 8% increase over the same period last year. The events generated over $181 million in business revenue for Montréal and Québec, and brought 835,000 convention-goers and participants to the city, despite the last-minute cancellation of two major events, including the World Police and Fire Games. The conventions drew an average of nearly 3,000 people, up almost 10% compared to the average for the last 5 years. These figures clearly speak to the appeal of Montréal as a professional meeting place for convention-goers from all over the world.
The Business Development team confirmed 17% more events this year than it did in 2016-17, which represents a significant increase. Totalling 388 overall, and slated for the coming months and years, these events are expected to attract an estimated 1.1 million convention-goers and participants, who will generate nearly $235 million in tourism revenue. Many conventions were secured thanks to the collaboration of city partners, especially Tourisme Montréal.
“2017-2018 was unquestionably a very good year for the Palais, shattering records on several fronts, including customer satisfaction rate, own-source revenues, average attendance for conventions, etc.,” declared Raymond Larivée, President and CEO of the Palais des congrès de Montréal. “Montréal hosts more international conventions than any other city in North America, and we fully intend to continue to play an active role in maintaining that standing for the province,” he added.
Dynamic local market
While hosting a steady number of conventions throughout the year, the Palais held 270 short-term events, such as conferences, meetings and galas, up 15% over last year. These special events drew a total of 176,000+ people, representing an increase of 14% compared to 2016-17.
Hosting major conventions
2017-2018 also accounted for 36 national and international conventions, many of which were large-scale events.

A Québec government corporation, the Palais rolled out several new strategies these past years to increase its own-source revenue. Thanks to the creativity and passion of its entire workforce, the Palais posted remarkable results, setting a record since opening in 1983.
Convention city
Montréal hosts more international events than any other city in North America, according to the rankings released by the International Congress and Convention Association. Shortlisted for the World’s Best Congress Centre award (AIPC) in 2018 and the recipient of the highest quality standards certification in the industry, the Palais des congrès de Montréal has all the necessary assets to host a major convention with the level of professionalism and creativity the city is known for. Winner of the APEX Innovation Award in 2017, the Palais continues to be a leading authority in the industry, as it has been for 35 years.
			
		
		
				
		
			
			
				Prestigious multisector strategic taskforce set up to attract even more international conferences to Montréal
				May 3, 2018
			
			
			The Palais des congrès de Montréal has assembled a group of leaders representing eight of the city’s key economic sectors to form a new Multisector Strategic Taskforce. Their mission will be to establish ties with influencers who will actively contribute to attracting major international conferences to Montréal and the Palais des congrès.
Among the members sitting on this prestigious taskforce are:

Frank Béraud, Chief Executive Officer of Montréal InVivo
Mathieu Charbonneau, Executive Director of CargoM
James J. Clark, Professor at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of McGill University
Fabrice Labeau, Interim Deputy Provost, Student Life and Learning, at McGill University
Marie Larue, Chief Executive Officer of the Institut de recherche Robert-Sauvé en santé et en sécurité du travail
Maryse Lassonde, Scientific Director of the Fonds de recherche du Québec – Nature et technologies
Serge Marchand, Scientific Director of the Fonds de recherche du Québec – Santé
Louise Poissant, Scientific Director of the Fonds de recherche du Québec – Société et culture

These top executives will become major collaborators in the process of finding researchers, scientists or business influencers who can be the difference maker when striving to persuade international associations that have been approached, to choose Montréal and the Palais as their destination for their next event. “The process of bidding for major international conferences is not unlike that of the Olympic Games, and many of these bids are won thanks to the paramount role these Montréal and Québec experts play. Their involvement shows global decision-makers the dynamic spirit and support that exists within the city’s key economic sectors,” stated Raymond Larivée, President and CEO of the Palais des congrès de Montréal, a Québec government corporation.
The role of the vastly experienced leaders who make up the new Multisector Strategic Taskforce will be to develop and nurture ties with researchers, scientists and business executives who might be inclined to actively participate in the process of bringing large-scale international gatherings to Montréal. They will be able to mine their networks for topnotch collaborators and match them with specific conferences.
Conferences advance science
Montréal is widely recognized as a knowledge hub. The city attracts international conferences that enable local researchers and experts to interact with peers who have travelled here from every continent. The Palais des congrès de Montréal works very closely with its Ambassadors and partners to advocate for the major sectors driving the Montréal and Québec economy. “Conventions represent a privileged opportunity to exchange with our peers from all over the world, and they help push the boundaries of knowledge for our industries. These intellectual benefits greatly contribute to Montréal’s international reputation,” added Hany Moustapha, President of the Ambassadors Club.
Let’s remember that over the years, the Palais has reached important agreements with partners like the Fonds de recherche du Québec for the purpose of raising the profile of Québec researchers and their fields of expertise.
A prolific Ambassadors Club
During the course of the Club’s 33 years, its members have definitely made a difference, attracting 201 events that have drawn nearly 475,000 participants, and generated benefits estimated at almost $1 billion. Not to mention the invaluable intellectual wealth, including the establishment of international working groups, the creation of new research areas and the recruitment of researchers.
Convention city
A leading international knowledge hub, Montréal hosts more international events than any other city in North America, according to the rankings released by the International Congress and Convention Association. Shortlisted for the World’s Best Congress Centre award (AIPC) and the recipient of the highest quality standards certification in the industry, the Palais des congrès de Montréal has all the necessary assets to host a major convention with the level of professionalism and creativity the city is known for.
			
		
		
				
		
			
			
				The Palais des congrès de Montréal earns major environmental recertification
				April 22, 2018
			
			
			The Palais des congrès de Montréal is proud to have had its BOMA BEST environmental certification renewed until 2020. This signifies that the Palais’ environmental performance and the fulfilment of its commitments have been duly recognized and certified by Canada’s largest environmental assessment and certification program.
“It is with pride and enthusiasm that we continue to maintain our commitment toward sustainable development, by multiplying our efforts in various areas of our operations,” indicated André Saucier, Vice-President, Finance and Administration, and also in charge of sustainable development at the Palais.
“We are pleased with our energy saving outcomes stemming from equipment we’ve replaced via our asset maintenance program, including the replacement of a chiller and two winter water towers, and the restoration of our summer water towers,” added Stéphane Alarie, the Palais’ Director of Building Management. “The complexity of managing operations tied to hosting different events at different times of the day renders this recertification that much more rewarding,” Alarie went on to say. Optimizing the control of fresh air supply circulating throughout the property’s distribution system has enabled the Palais to reduce its energy consumption by almost 3%, in a building that hosts nearly 350 events a year, 900,000 visitors, and spans 1.4 million sq. ft.
A commitment entrenched in business practices
Responsible, determined and committed, the Palais des congrès de Montréal became, in 2005, one of the first convention centres in Canada to be BOMA BEST certified. The Sustainability Action Plan and Sustainable Development Policy at the core of its strategy are ensuring the viability of its commitment. Also, the Responsible Procurement Policy it recently adopted is raising awareness among the Palais' staff, partners and suppliers about the importance of consuming, producing and purchasing responsibly.
An urban farming lab as a form of green roofing
When the Palais des congrès de Montréal opened its Urban Agriculture Lab in 2016, in collaboration with AU/Lab, an organization associated with the faculty of science and the institute of environmental science of the Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM), it became the main showcase in Québec for experimenting with and advocating for urban farming technologies and techniques.

The Lab’s VERTical project is among the activities endorsed by the “Carrefour de recherche, d’expertise et de transfert en agriculture urbaine” jointly set up by the Québec department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the city of Montréal and UQAM. The project, which earned the Palais the 2017 AIPC Innovation Award, has attracted the interest of the scientific community and the media.
 
A certifiably green host destination
Montréal and the Palais are ASTM-APEX certified (Accepted Practices Exchange) as a green convention site.
			
		
		
				
		
			
			
				Human-Computer interaction: Key aspect of technology being tackled at the Palais des congrès de Montréal
				April 20, 2018
			
			
			From April 21 to 26, 2018, human-computer interaction will receive a thorough examination during the CHI 2018 international conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems held at the Palais des congrès de Montréal. This prominent conference will attract 3,000+ delegates from 50 countries and bring in an estimated $6.7 million in tourism revenue for the city and Québec.
“Montréal hosts the most international events in all of North America and AI is a field we continue to excel in. We feel privileged to welcome these world experts and to play an active role in bringing them together, which will help generate significant intellectual wealth for the province,” stated Raymond Larivée, President and CEO of the Palais des congrès de Montréal. “The cooperation between the various industry partners, especially Tourisme Montréal, made it possible to attract this major conference, and we are eager to welcome the attendees,” added Larivée.

Widely recognized as the world’s most important showcase for human-computer interaction, CHI gathers thousands of the top researchers, scientists, and designers in the world to present their latest research, solve their hardest problems, learn new material and build their networks. Originally a small conference for psychologists interested in user interface design, the annual CHI conference has grown to include a diverse group of interaction designers, computer scientists, engineering psychologists, developers, and performing artists. CHI also addresses the organizational integration of technology, and the use of technology in all areas of life.
City known as AI and IT hub
Montréal offers a fertile setting for developing a topnotch scientific and professional program for CHI delegates. In fact, the city enjoys the support of numerous universities and centres specializing in fundamental and applied research. These include the McGill University Centre for Intelligent Machines, the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms (MILA) and the Institute for Data Valorization (Ivado), both associated with Université de Montréal, the Laboratory for Imagery, Vision and Artificial Intelligence (LIVIA) of the ÉTS school of engineering, Concordia University’s Centre for Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence (CENPARMI), and the Computer Research Institute of Montréal (CRIM).
Convention city
Montréal hosts more international events than any other city in North America, according to the rankings released by the International Congress and Convention Association. Shortlisted for the World’s Best Congress Centre award (AIPC) and the recipient of the highest quality standards certification in the industry, the Palais des congrès de Montréal enjoys the collaboration of leaders from various sectors, who in turn can count on the Palais’ experience and support. It is a synergy that continues to foster the international reputation of industries as they evolve.
			
		
		
				
		
			
			
				A Palais des congrès de Montréal marketing campaign earns international distinction
				December 5, 2017
			
			
			The meetings and conventions world recognized the work of the Palais des congrès de Montréal at the Meeting Industry Marketing Awards (MIMA) recently presented in London. The “Numbers 1-5-52” relationship marketing and communications campaign intended for the international, U.S. and national convention markets earned the Palais the prestigious award for Best Integrated Marketing Campaign. The Palais was also shortlisted in the Best Use of Budget and Marketing Team of the Year categories.
“There’s a promotional component in our approach strategies that people notice, which this international recognition speaks to, and we are honoured. We have a magnificent convention centre and a vibrant city known for its creativity, and it is our duty to show them in the best possible light,” states Chrystine Loriaux, Palais des congrès de Montréal Director of Marketing and Communications. “This campaign, which branches out to reach several geographic markets, enabled us to convey three essential messages to potential customers looking for a venue for their next international convention,” concludes Loriaux.

1-5-52: Three numbers that speak volumes
This relationship marketing campaign was rolled out by the Palais in international, U.S. and national convention markets and was aimed at associations in the final stages of deciding which city would host their next event. With a limited campaign budget, the Palais set out to attract the attention of decision-makers with a creative message and design to secure a premium spot for Montréal and its main convention centre on the shortlist of host destinations under consideration. The campaign revolved around three numbers that are undisputedly Montréal, figures that contribute to the city’s brand within the convention market, i.e.:

1: Montréal is the #1 host city in the Americas for international events (according to the International Union of Associations);
5: Montréal has retained that top spot for five straight years (2011-2015);
52: Montréal accounts for 52% of all the international events held in major Canadian cities.

The “Numbers 1-5-52” campaign was a joint effort between the Palais’ marketing and communications, business development, and research teams, and the Samarkand Design+Communication firm.
A year filled with accolades
The Meetings + Incentive Travel trade magazine recently announced the winners of their Readers’ Choice Awards. The Palais des congrès was on the list, having earned an honourable mention in the Best Venue – Central Canada category. Palais partner Tourisme Montréal was also among the readers’ favourites, with an honourable mention in the Best Destination Marketing Organization category. These recognitions are on top of the Palais winning the AIPC Innovation Award earlier this year for its Urban Agriculture Lab – a prestigious international award given by the International Association of Convention Centres (AIPC).

				November 30, 2017
			
			
			The Palais des congrès de Montréal and Fonds de recherche du Québec (FRQ), along with Québec’s Chief Scientist, Rémi Quirion, seized their annual exchange forum to announce the winners of the Palais des congrès de Montréal Ambassadors Club – Fonds de recherche du Québec Awards, which recognize the work of researchers actively involved in organizing international scientific conferences. The three $10,000 awards went to:

Pierre Giovenazzo of Université Laval
46th Apimondia International Apicultural Congress 2019
8,000 delegates and $20.5 M in tourism revenues


Fiona Darbyshire of UQÀM
27th IUGG General Assembly 2019 - International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics
4,000 delegates and $16.3 M in tourism revenues


Philippe Archambault of Université Laval
World Conference on Marine Biodiversity
800 delegates and $1.5 M in tourism revenues


Rémi Quirion, Chief Scientist of Québec, with Philippe Archambault, Fiona Darbyshire, Pierre Giovenazzo and Hany Moustapha, President of the Ambassadors Club.
“Winning a bid to host a major conference helps generate significant intellectual wealth, and also contributes to promoting the field of science as well as the reputations of those associated with the event. Montréal hosts more international conventions than any other city in North America, and the Palais is proud to play an active role in putting together the bids in order to support the work of these professionals looking to welcome their peers to Montréal,” says Raymond Larivée, President and CEO of the Palais des congrès de Montréal, a Québec government corporation.
“Conventions are an important part of researchers’ scientific communication. They allow for peer-to-peer discussion on progress in a specific field, but can also be an opportunity to raise awareness of a disciplinary field and the research findings outside the academic community, toward the general public. At the Fonds de recherche du Québec, we strive/intend to pursue our efforts to support researchers who take this path”, reinforces Rémi Quirion, Chief Scientist of Québec.
Titled Talking about science in 2017: Challenges and outlook, the third edition of the forum brought together more than 100 researchers, research centre managers, university administrators and members of the Ambassadors Club, who engaged in dynamic discussions and workshops in order to come up with possible actions on how to best communicate science. The forum is a joint effort between the Palais des congrès de Montréal and Fonds de recherche du Québec, organized within the scope of a partnership agreement in place since 2014.
			
		
		
				
		
			
			
				The Palais des congrès de Montréal and McGill University’s James Clark bring a major AI conference to the city
				November 24, 2017
			
			
			Thanks to the hard work and determination of James J. Clark, a professor at the McGill Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Director of its Centre for Intelligent Machines, and of Marc-André Gemme, a member of the Palais des congrès de Montréal’s business development team, 6,000 delegates will be converging in Montréal in October 2021 for the IEEE Computer Society’s International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV). This major international conference, which is expected to translate into 16,800 room nights for the city’s hotels, will generate an estimated $12.7 million in tourism revenues for Montréal and Québec. This large-scale high-tech event is the 3rd artificial intelligence (AI) conference the Palais des congrès has announced in the last 3 months, news that confirms the city’s expertise and global standing in the field of AI.
Proud of the outcome after more than a year of hard work, Professor Clark said: “Winning the bid speaks to the importance of making clear the added value of hosting this major international event in Montréal. I’d like to thank Marc-André Gemme who played an active role in bringing this conference to our city, by talking to and persuading many of the people who participated in the voting and selection process. I look forward to working with the members of the Palais team these next 4 years on putting together a high-quality conference. Montréal is known for its advanced technological expertise, and this represents an opportunity for the city to showcase its active AI industry and excellent research centres.” Professor Clark will continue to enjoy the support of the Palais des congrès de Montréal and Tourisme Montréal, as well as that of the local organizing committee, for matters related to the planning, promotion and hosting of the conference.
A committee packed with luminaries
What tilted the balance in Montréal’s favour is without a doubt the quality of the organizing committee put together by Professor Clark, whose presence helped clinch the bid. This shows the importance of having a rich scientific program for a conference in a field as specialized as computer vision.
“Montréal hosts more international events than any other city in North America, and artificial intelligence features in numerous major conventions focused on the future. We have the privilege of hosting these world experts and playing an active role in bringing them together in the heart of our city, which will translate into significant intellectual benefits for the city and the province,” stated Raymond Larivée, President and CEO of the Palais des congrès de Montréal. This bid was made possible thanks to the support of numerous partners, including funding from Tourisme Montréal.
City emerging as an AI and ICT hub
With its world-renowned speakers, luminaries and advanced research centres, Montréal has become fertile ground and the quintessential setting for developing a topnotch scientific and professional program for ICCV delegates. In fact, the city enjoys the support of four major universities and is home to numerous centres specializing in fundamental and applied research in computer vision and machine learning, and is shaping the next generation of engineers and scientists in the field. These include the McGill University Centre for Intelligent Machines, an inter-departmental group formed in 1985 to facilitate and promote research on intelligent systems. The city can also count on the reputable expertise of the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms (MILA) and the Institute for Data Valorization (Ivado), both associated with Université de Montréal, the Laboratory for Imagery, Vision and Artificial Intelligence (LIVIA) of the ÉTS school of engineering, Concordia University’s Centre for Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence (CENPARMI), and the Computer Research Institute of Montréal (CRIM).

				Montréal continuing to emerge as major AI player with two conventions coming to Palais des congrès de Montréal
				October 30, 2017
			
			
			The Palais des congrès de Montréal will be hosting two artificial intelligence (AI) conventions, more evidence of just how dynamically this scientific field is developing in the city. The 30th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI) will be coming in 2021 and attract nearly 3,000 experts from all over the world. This means a total of nearly 8,400 room nights booked in Montréal hotels and over $4.5 million in tourism revenue for Québec.
Montréal was awarded the international convention, whose bid was coordinated by Marie-France Polidori of the Palais de congrès de Montréal business development team, during the 2017 edition of the event in Melbourne last August. The remarkable support from Joëlle Pineau and Doina Precup proved a determining factor in attracting this major event, made possible thanks to the committed work of the organizing committee, which consisted of representatives from Université du Québec à Montréal, McGill University – including Professor Gregory Dudek, a member of the Ambassadors Club – Université de Montréal, HEC Montréal, Polytechnique, Concordia University, and funding from Tourisme Montréal.

Renowned academics
Professor Joëlle Pineau, who teaches computer science at McGill University, specializes in robotics and machine learning. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau recently announced she will head Facebook’s new AI research lab in Montréal. Doina Precup, also a professor of computer science at McGill, will lead the Montréal office of DeepMind, a leading artificial intelligence company bought by Google in 2014.
New innovative conference announced
Determined to position Québec as an AI hub, and in order to continue to foster their respective missions, the Université de Montréal, Fonds de recherche du Québec and Palais des congrès de Montréal joined forces to create the new Forum on the Socially Responsible Development of Artificial Intelligence, which will take place November 2 and 3 at the Palais. By bringing together experts from fields ranging from pure science to the humanities and social sciences, the Forum will provide a platform for a collective discussion on the ethical and socially responsible development of AI.
Prominent luminaries expected
Keynote speakers will include Yoshua Bengio, leading world figure in deep learning, Canada Research Chair in Statistical Learning Algorithms, and author of three books and over 300 scientific articles, Joëlle Pineau, Yochai Benkler, Berkman Professor of Entrepreneurial Legal Studies at Harvard Law School, Hugo Larochelle, Google Brain Researcher, and Bryn Williams-Jones, Director of the Bioethics Program at the Université de Montréal School of Public Health.
The forum will also provide the backdrop for the drafting of the guiding principles of the Montréal Declaration on the Ethical Development of AI.
“Montréal hosts more international events than any other city in North America, and artificial intelligence features in numerous major conventions focused on the future. We have the privilege of hosting these world experts and playing an active role in bringing them together in the heart of our city, which will translate into significant intellectual benefits for the city and the province,” stated Raymond Larivée, President and CEO of the Palais des congrès de Montréal.

				Palais des congrès de Montréal wins prestigious international innovation award for its Urban Agriculture Lab
				July 5, 2017
			
			
			The Palais des congrès de Montréal was presented with the prestigious AIPC Innovation Award on July 4, 2017 at the AIPC International Association of Convention Centres Annual Conference in Sydney, Australia. The Palais was recognized for its Urban Agriculture Lab and its innovations in sustainable development. The Lab was among the 16 convention centre entries shortlisted for the award. “We are proud of the sustainability leadership role we play within the industry through our tangible actions. By opening the Urban Agriculture Lab in tandem with partners like the Laboratoire sur l’agriculture urbaine (AU/LAB) and Ligne Verte, the Palais is fostering experimentation with new rooftop urban farming technologies and practices, and in the process, is also reducing heat islands in the city’s downtown core,” declared Raymond Larivée, President and CEO of the Palais des congrès de Montréal.
The AIPC Innovation Award recognizes excellence in convention centre management by showcasing initiatives that represent innovation, namely through the development of a new, more creative or more effective approach to any aspect of convention centre management, operations or marketing. The Palais des congrès was the Overall Innovation Award Winner as selected by the committee, while the Cairns Convention Center was the Innovation Award Delegates’ Choice – it won for a promotional item made from steel recovered from their old roof.

“We have an immense rooftop surface right in the heart of the city, and we knew that by working with environmental experts, we could make a positive contribution by repurposing this vast space. Scientists, engineers, crop farmers, bee farmers, managers and a host of other specialists worked together with the Palais’ building management team to make this project happen, which we believe will inspire other property owners to do the same,” mentioned Chrystine Loriaux, the Palais des congrès Director of Marketing and Communications.
According to Eric Duchemin, AU/LAB’s Scientific Director: “Partnering with the Palais des congrès on the Laboratory initiative will make it possible to broaden our knowledge of the challenges and constraints associated with rooftop farming, but it will also serve to build rooftop farms, in Montréal and abroad.” The project is part of CRETAU, a network created in collaboration with the Québec Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, which focuses on urban farming research and expertise, and the transfer of urban farming best practices.
In 2016, the Palais des congrès de Montréal became the main showcase in Québec for experimenting with and advocating for urban farming technologies and techniques, when it opened its Urban Agriculture Lab jointly with AU/LAB, an organization associated with the faculty of science and institute of environmental studies at Université du Québec à Montréal. The Urban Agriculture Lab includes:

Culti-VERT, a technological showcase for green roofs and container gardening;
Three pollinating beehives; and
VERTical, an urban agriculture project driven by new vertical farming technology that is based on free-standing structures equipped with experimental wall tarps.

The various components of the Palais Urban Agriculture Lab are primarily tasked with:

				Wanted: Researchers to attract conventions - Palais des congrès and Fonds de recherche du Québec strengthen their partnership
				May 31, 2017
			
			
			The Palais des congrès de Montréal, its Ambassadors Club and the Fonds de recherche du Québec further bolstered their partnership, whose aim is to promote Québec scientific research by attracting international conventions to Montréal. The agreement, which runs until 2019, fosters closer cooperation between the scientific community and the Palais des congrès in order to bring more major conferences to Montréal – events that will generate both intellectual wealth and tourism revenue that will benefit the entire community.

Montréal is known globally as a knowledge hub thanks its world class researchers, universities and research centres. “Their involvement is invaluable to the process of bringing an international convention to Montréal. It shows international decision-makers the dynamic spirit and support that exists within the city’s key economic sectors,” says Raymond Larivée, President and CEO of the Palais des congrès de Montréal, a Québec government corporation. “Conventions represent a privileged opportunity to exchange with our peers from all over the world, and they help push the boundaries of knowledge for our industries. These intellectual benefits greatly contribute to Montréal’s international reputation,” adds Professor Hany Moustapha, President of the Ambassadors Club.
“It is important for researchers to get involved in organizing international scientific conferences. Those who’ve done it know that although it demands a lot of time, the benefits to their research career is invaluable. Which is why the Fonds de recherche du Québec are proud of this partnership, and also that the competition recognizing the work of researchers in organizing big scientific conferences will continue to thrive,” points out Rémi Quirion, Québec’s Chief Scientist.
Annual grants
Among the terms of the partnership is the awarding of the Prix du Club des Ambassadeurs du Palais des congrès de Montréal et des Fonds de recherche du Québec, grants recognizing the work of researchers invested in organizing international scientific conventions. The first recipients were announced in November 2016, during the Fonds de recherche du Québec forum organized annually by the partners. They are:

Gaétan Laroche and Diego Mantovani of Université Laval, in collaboration with Sophie Lerouge of the ETS school of engineering, for the 10th World Biomaterials Congress
Grant presented by the Fonds de recherche – Nature et technologies
Jean-Marie Dufour of McGill University, for the 11th World Congress of the Econometric Society
Grant presented by the Fonds de recherche – Société et culture
Pierre Talbot of INRS-Institut Armand-Frappier, for the International Congress of Microbiology
Grant presented by the Fonds de recherche – Santé

Promoting science by hosting international conferences
The three-year agreement is also focused on actions aimed at shining the spotlight on the research of those who invest themselves in winning and organizing an international convention in their field. Through their cooperation, the Fonds de recherche du Québec and the Palais des congrès de Montréal make sure the economic and intellectual benefits for Montréal and the province are maximized.
