                                        The Montréal aerospace industry is bolstering its leadership role with the launch of AÉROÉTS, an organization whose purpose is to position the ÉTS engineering school as a world-class aerospace school. The director of the organization is none other than Hany Moustapha, who is also an Emeritus Ambassador of the Palais and co-chair of the Palais' Major Aerospace Events Commitee.
                                        In the coming years, through the work of the taskforce and the support of the economic cluster represented by Aéro Montréal in the area of promoting and developing aerospace, the Palais plans to increase its efforts to attract more large-scale aerospace related conventions and events. The taskforce is even considering holding a Montréal Aerospace Week as of 2013.
                                        A reminder that Greater Montréal is among the world' biggest aerospace centres, along with Seattle and Toulouse, and has the second highest density of aerospace jobs worldwide. Over 98% of Québec's aerospace activity is concentrated in Greater Montréal, making it one of the rare places in the world where virtually every component required to build an aircraft can be found within a 30 km radius.
