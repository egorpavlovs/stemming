The “Relève étoile” competition is organized by the three research branches of the Fonds de recherche du Québec. It recognizes the excellent research being conducted by young researchers and helps foster research careers within Québec universities. At the Gala, Serge Marchand, Scientific Director of the FRQ, paid tribute to this year’s three award recipients:

Prix Relève étoile Jacques-Genest, Fonds Santé (Fund supporting the health sciences)
Catherine Bélanger, PhD student in Biochemistry, UQAM
Award-winning paper: “Dysregulation of cotranscriptional alternative splicing underlies CHARGE syndrome,” published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
 
Prix Relève étoile Paul-Gérin-Lajoie, Fonds société et culture (Fund supporting the social sciences and humanities, arts and letters)

Maude Brunet, Postdoctoral intern in Construction Engineering
Award-winning paper: “The governance of major public infrastructure projects: the process of translation,” published in the International Journal of Managing Projects in Business
 
Winners of the 2018 IRSST – Ambassadors Club Award
The Palais des congrès de Montréal and the Institut de recherche Robert-Sauvé en santé et en sécurité du travail (IRSST) have decided to coordinate their actions and resources in order to help promote OHS research by attracting major national and international conferences to Montréal.
Together, they introduced the IRSST – Ambassadors Club award in 2018, and the very first recipients of the award were presented at the Gala by IRSST President and CEO Marie Larue, in recognition for bringing the 26th International Congress on Sound and Vibration (ICSV26) to Montréal.
