                          The Palais des congrès de Montréal emerged as the runner-up for the APEX Award in Recognition of the Highest Client Rating Received by a Convention Centre. The Palais earned the prestigious international accolade, presented on July 3 in London, on the strength of an exceptional score.
The AIPC APEX Award honours the world’s convention centre with the best customer satisfaction rating for quality. This comes on the heels of the AIPC having recently Gold Quality Standard certified the Palais des congrès, meaning the Montréal venue now joins a very small group of convention centres having both received that certification and also been shortlisted for the APEX Award in recognition of their customer service excellence. “We are very proud of this distinction, which reflects how passionate our teams are about satisfying our clients,” declared Raymond Larivée, President and CEO of the Palais des congrès de Montréal. “When you combine our employees’ knowhow with the excellent quality of our offering, this allows us to deliver the very best to our customers, as we continually strive to exceed their expectations,” he added.
AIPC Apex Award
The AIPC Apex Award is a bi-annual recognition of excellence in convention centre customer service quality. The winner and the two runners-up are determined on the basis of a comprehensive analysis of centre performance in a wide range of areas based on customer satisfaction surveys. A separate independent evaluation process carried out by Ipsos ensures a review of factors such as project management quality, as well as catering and technical capacity.
