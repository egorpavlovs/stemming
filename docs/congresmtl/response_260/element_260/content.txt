                                            Denis Coderre presented with Ambassador Achievement Award
                                        
                                        
                                            
                                              
                                              The Palais des congrès de Montréal presented its Ambassador Achievement Award to Mr. Denis Coderre during its 2017 Recognition Award Gala, for significantly contributing to Montréal’s international reputation through his dedication and leadership.
                                              After a long career as a member of Parliament and federal minister, Denis Coderre was elected mayor of Montréal in 2013. Already an ardent Montréal promoter, it is as mayor that he elevated the city to the international stage by adopting a global, outward-looking worldview.
                                              In addition to creating the Office of International Relations, he reached out to the world’s major cities. He has taken part in a number of trade missions and joined numerous international organizations, including the Strong Cities Network, a network of mayors and municipal-level policy makers united in countering extremism, and Metropolis, the world’s leading association of big cities, whose presidency he took over in 2015.
                                              His determination to make Montréal a smart city – namely by establishing a Smart and Digital City Office and playing a role in the creation of MTL WiFi, in collaboration with the Palais des congrès – earned our city the title of Intelligent Community of the Year in 2016.
                                              In 2017, Denis Coderre’s love of Montréal’s continues unabated. He has contributed to the organization of celebrations surrounding the city’s 375th anniversary and invited citizens from all over the world to discover or rediscover this city we are all so proud of.
                                          Denis Coderre has also been appointed Emeritus Ambassador, as a result of his active involvement in the process of attracting and hosting two major conventions, i.e. the Global Social Economic Forum – GSEF2016 and the XII Metropolis World Congress.
