Sustainable development

                        What it is and what it means at the Palais
Sustainable development is about meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. It is based on a long-term approach that takes into account the inextricable nature of environmental, social and economic development activities.
Responsible, determined and engaged, the Palais des congrès de Montréal shares the concerns of citizens who recognize the importance of getting involved personally and collectively. We must fundamentally behave sustainably, now more than ever. The Palais des congrès de Montréal’s Sustainable Development Policy (in French only) and Sustainability Action Plan (in French only) enable us to perpetuate our commitment to sustainable development.
Also, our Responsible Procurement Policy (in French only) contributes to rendering the Palais' staff, partners and suppliers increasingly aware of the importance of consuming, producing and purchasing responsibly.
The momentum we began generating nearly 15 years ago is paying dividends. From how we design them to how they’re executed, our methods and practices are thriving and the Palais continues to implement initiatives that significantly contribute to sustainable development.
Sustainable development initiatives
ENVIRONMENTAL COMPONENT
Raising awareness about sustainable development
We use information bulletins and training sessions to spread the word about the nature and scope of the principles of sustainability.
Examples of initiatives:

Publication of articles on the Palais intranet site and blog
Training sessions
Meetings with employees

Green events
Because of the nature of our mission, we encourage green events while also contributing to fostering industry practices that reduce our events’ environmental footprint. The Palais won the Conseil québécois des événements écoresponsables’ 2013 Vivats award in the host site category. It is also ASTM certified as a green convention site.
Examples of initiatives:

Packages and services for organizing green events
Promoting the sale of e-tickets

Environmental management
The tangible environmental initiatives we implement speak to our desire and commitment to changing the course of events.
Examples of initiatives:

Repurposing of the Palais roofs by converting them into green spaces through the Palais’ Urban Agriculture Lab, winner of the 2017 AIPC Innovation Award. The Lab is comprised of:

Culti-VERT, a showcase of green roof and gardening containers technologies
VERTical, an initiative regarding urban vertical farming on scaffolds
Pollinating bee hives
Urban Vines, Canada's first urban rooftop vineyard


Installing and operating pollinating bee hives
Installing charging stations for electric vehicles
Installing electronic waste recycling bins
Implementing an environmental management system

Building management
Our commitment to saving energy and managing sustainably dates back to when we expanded. It has since been recognized frequently, by our BOMA BESTTM certification, our Énergia award from the AQME Québec association for power management, and our admittance into the Hydro-Québec Energy Savers’ Circle.
Examples of initiatives:

Ongoing use of energy saving measures
Reducing the building’s greenhouse gas emissions
Reducing the residual waste generated by our activities

Collaborating with partners
As a business tourism leader in Québec, the Palais collaborates with its partners on integrated sustainable development projects.
Examples of initiatives:

Helping the city obtain its ASTM certification
Sitting on Tourisme Montréal’s environmental committee
Supporting the City of Montréal’s sustainable development plan

SOCIAL COMPONENT
Workplace health
Prevention is at the very core of the Palais’ approach to workplace health, by making it possible for employees to be physically active.
Examples of initiatives:

Lending Bixi keys to employees during lunchtime
Making areas available for yoga, fitness classes, locker rooms

Community involvement
We strive to make a difference in our community by encouraging our employees, partners and suppliers to display their social solidarity through tangible actions.
Examples of initiatives:

Journée Coup de pouce, which promotes volunteering among our employees
Entraide campaign, which raises funds for the neediest
Action Médiation, an outreach program aimed at fostering a system of cohabitation between downtown Montréal tourists and the homeless
Donating surplus food to Maison du père

Promoting culture
The Palais owns several works of art and takes part in activities that promote Montréal culture.
Examples of initiatives:

Broader access to the collection of artwork displayed at the Palais thanks to the Art Public Montréal portal
Participating in Art souterrain (art exhibited in Montréal’s underground city)
Sponsoring Vitrine culturelle (cultural info centre and box office)
Outfits worn by our greeters and reception area staff created by a Québec designer
