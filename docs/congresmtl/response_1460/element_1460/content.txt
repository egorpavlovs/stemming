                          During the course of its 2014-15 financial year, the Palais des congrès de Montréal hosted a total of 347 events, which drew a record-setting 194,000+ business tourists. In total, 837,000 people visited the Palais to attend either a convention, meeting, gala, conference, consumer or trade show, representing the biggest overall attendance ever since the Palais opened its doors. The new record supplants the one set last year, which was 766,100. Overall, 48 conventions were held in the year -- 25 international1 conventions and 23 national2 conventions. The numbers add up to the best performance ever in the Palais’ 32-year history! In terms of exhibitions, events totalled 49, the highest since 2008-09. In total, the events held made it possible for the Société du Palais des congrès de Montréal to generate nearly $242,000,000 in economic benefits, representing an increase of almost 16% over last year and 23% more than the average for the last 5 years.
“The growing number of business tourists we attract spurs us to continue to be a leader in our industry and thus enable Québec to reap even more economic benefits from the major events we host,” says Raymond Larivée, President and CEO of the Société du Palais des congrès de Montréal, who added: “Our city’s reputation, hotels and the quality of our convention centre play a big role in that success, and it’s something we can all be proud of.”
Many of the noteworthy conventions held in 2014-15 were confirmed with the collaboration of members from the Palais des congrès de Montréal Ambassadors Club:

23rd World Congress of the IPSA
Ambassadors: Mr. Stéphane Paquin (Appointed) and Mr. Guy Lachapelle (Emeritus)
2 500 participants and nearly $6M in economic benefits
 The Congresses of the International Union of Microbiological Societies

 2014-15 Fourth quarter results
In the fourth quarter, the Palais confirmed 8 international1 conventions and 11 national2 conventions. These major events, secured with the collaboration of Tourisme Montréal and Palais Ambassadors, will bring in nearly $53 million for the Montréal and Québec economy. On the exhibitions side, 25 events were confirmed, which is comparable to last year. All told, the events confirmed during the quarter and in connection with business tourism will help generate nearly $77,000,000 for the economy and almost 49,000 room nights.
Annual review 2014-15 - confirmed events
During the year, the business development team helped confirm 358 events to be held in the future, which will translate into economic benefits estimated at nearly $181,000,000. These include 36 conventions, 18 international1 and 18 national2. A total of 48 exhibitions were booked during the same period, including 25 tradeshows. Together, the future conventions and tradeshows confirmed during the year will contribute to nearly 110,000 room nights being booked in hotels across the city.
 
The top host city3 in the Americas for international events, Montréal once again enjoyed an enviable reputation worldwide. Gold certified during the year by the AIPC Quality Standards, which measure a convention centre’s quality and management performance, the Palais des congrès de Montréal was also shortlisted as a finalist for the prestigious APEX award for World's Best Convention Centre4.
