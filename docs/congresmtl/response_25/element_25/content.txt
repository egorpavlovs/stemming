1977 – Construction of the Palais begins
1983 – Inauguration of the Palais, which welcomes its first events
Late 1990's – The government of Québec invests $290 million to finance the expansion of the Palais, allowing the convention centre to double its size
2002 – The Palais inaugurates its new contemporary, friendly, and infinitely global minded facilities
2011- 2012 – The Palais des congrès has welcomed a record of 368 events, 657,043 participants, generating 146,724 hotel room nights and more than $200,177,477 in economic spinoffs
Montréal, premium destination for major international events
The Palais des congrès de Montréal contributes to Montréal’s international reputation and generates important intellectual and economic spinoffs for Québec by making the city and the Palais premium destinations for major international events.
