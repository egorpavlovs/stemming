		Club des Ambassadeurs
					
    
    2015 marks the 30th anniversary of the Palais des congrès de Montréal Ambassadors Club. This important milestone was duly acknowledged at the Recognition Award Gala, as was its significance both historically for the Palais and for the men and women who have brought major international conventions to Montréal, i.e. the Ambassadors themselves.
Dr. Pavel Hamet, president of the Ambassadors Club, receives a commemorative plaque from Mr. Raymond Larivée, CEO of the Palais des congrès.
Ambassadors are professionals or academics, influential and dynamic personalities from Montréal’s economic sectors of excellence, who are passionate about their field of expertise and their city. In addition to their usual work, they are also actively involved in supporting and promoting Montréal’s bids to host international conventions, which generate economic and intellectual benefits for the city and the province.
The Ambassadors Club has been growing year after year since 1985. Today, it has nearly 300 members who pool together their efforts to make Montréal a great hub of knowledge and knowledge sharing. The Ambassadors Club marked its 30th Anniversary by inducting 14 new members who were instrumental in securing 10 international conventions for Montréal. These major events will generate nearly $129 M in economic benefits for the city and the province, and attract 40,000 business tourists to Montréal
