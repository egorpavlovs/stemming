Montréal: giving a premium flavour to any event!

Add the essence of Montréal to your Canadian event!
A beautiful blend of European flair and North American efficiency, Montréal is ranked the top convention citiy in the Americas. It’s also a vibrant city at the forefront of higher learning and innovation, and one that is incredibly safe.
A strategic location
The Palais is located only 20 minutes from Montréal-Trudeau airport. Its strategic location in the heart of Montréal means the Palais is only a 10-minute walk from 15,000 hotel rooms. It’s also accessible by bike or Bixi or on foot, via public transit by train or via the underground city and steps away from a central train station. Travelling by car? Not a problem, we’ve got 1,600 indoor parking spaces and we are conveniently located near autoroute Ville-Marie (autoroute 720).
Modern and versatile facilities
Planning and hosting your convention at the Palais offers a world of possibilities. In this AIPC Quality Standards gold certified centre, you will have access to 550,000 sq. ft. of ultramodern event space housed within a sophisticated multipurpose environment equipped with the latest state-of-the-art technology.
