                          The Montréal International Auto Show, the biggest consumer show in Québec, will be held January 18–27 at Palais des congrès de Montréal. Some 200,000 attendees are expected at this year’s event, whose main theme is electric mobility.

“We’re proud to be hosting Québec’s most popular auto event. Our facilities are a perfect fit for large-scale consumer shows like this,” said Robert Mercure, CEO of Palais des congrès de Montréal. “It’s an honour for us to showcase the know-how of local auto specialists and give car enthusiasts a chance to check out the eco-friendly options on the market,” he added.
An event like the Auto Show takes up almost all the space available at the Palais and presents considerable logistical challenges. During set-up, Auto Show and Palais staff have to coordinate the arrival of more than 425 truckloads of automobile manufacturers’ and exhibitors’ equipment at the 15 loading bays, not to mention the 500 cars and other vehicles visitors can’t wait to admire. It’s an operation that has been fine-tuned and improved every year since 2002. The Palais’s versatile facilities are perfect for the show as they can easily accommodate oversize booths. More than 700 rigging hooks will be needed to hang the imposing structures and decor!
Setup operations for the Auto Show start January 7, with tear-down to be completed by January 30.
An electrifying event!
Car buffs, take note: The 76th Auto Show will feature a record 42 electric vehicles on display throughout the venue.
New this year is The Generator, a zone dedicated to electric mobility. Here visitors will be able to learn more about electric products and services.
At the Hydro-Québec stage within The Generator, visitors will be able to attend a variety of general audience presentations on different facets of electric mobility. Auto Show ticket holders can also attend science talks for the general public offered free of charge by Centre Délic, FLO, CAA-Québec, and Équiterre.
Focus on innovation
The 2019 Auto Show features several new attractions, such as the mysterious Black Box. In this special room, visitors will be able to view two of the three fastest cars in the world and an exotic car designed entirely in Québec. The Garage, an updated version of The Performance Zone, is sure to be popular among modified car fans.
The full schedule is available on the Montréal International Auto Show website:

The Palais, convenient and accessible
Located in the heart of downtown, Palais des congrès is easy to get to by car and public transit or on foot. There is direct access to the metro and Montréal’s underground walkways. From the parking lot at the corner or Chenneville and Viger, visitors can access the show without having to go outside. Public charging stations for electric cars are available nearby. The shops and amenities at Galeries du Palais mall will also be open throughout the show.
