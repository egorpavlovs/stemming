The ground floor of the Palais des congrès is close to the action



                        A large venue to suit your needs
The ground floor of the Palais des congrès is ideal for welcoming large events. On the west side, the 54,000 sq. ft. (5,100 m2) Hall Place Riopelle, with a capacity of 5,260 people, is an elegant and accessible venue that is perfect for registration-related activities. Set against the backdrop of the centre’s famed coloured glass exterior, it is also adjacent to a magnificent public garden.
The vast central concourse can accommodate consumer shows for maximum exposure.
Linked to city’s networks
Level 1 is linked to the metro system (Place-d’Armes station, orange line) and to Montréal’s underground city, which connects the centre directly to 4,500 hotel rooms.
Practical amenities
Les Galeries du Palais is a commercial mall where visitors can find a plethora of services and boutiques, including restaurants, car rental services, an art gallery, a beauty salon, and much more.
A cloakroom, freight elevator, truck waiting area and security station are nearby and always at your service to ensure your activities run smoothly.
