                        Strategically located in the heart of the International district and right next to the Place-d’Armes metro station, Les Galeries du Palais is a shopping promenade in the Palais des congrès that is easily accessible and the ideal location for your special events, trade shows, or consumer shows. For instance, in 2010 and 2011 we welcomed the Marché Casse-Noisette of Les Grands Ballets Canadiens, and proceeds were used to support this famous Montréal institution. More than 3,000 people walk through Les Galeries every day, making this a perfect showcase for your events.
A cocktail amid a pink forest
Les Galeries includes two exceptional spaces that are perfect for your next cocktail party:

The Jardin Nature légère / Lipstick Forest and its pink-coloured trees, a unique space in Montréal
the interior area of the Palais, between St. Antoine and Viger Streets, where multicoloured glass panels create a beautiful kaleidoscope effect on the floor
