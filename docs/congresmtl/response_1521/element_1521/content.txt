    During the Recognition Award Gala held on March 30, 2016, the Palais des congrès and its Ambassadors Club presented a special Grand Ambassador Award to Yves Michaud, who gave the Palais des congrès its initial spark, and in so doing, contributed to Québec’s global profile and Montréal’s international reputation.
Yves Michaud was appointed President and CEO of the Palais des congrès de Montréal in 1984. One year later, he created the Ambassadors Club. Under his guidance, the Palais proudly joined the ranks of the world’s top business destinations.
After being posted to several international organizations as a representative of Québec and serving as diplomatic advisor to the Québec Premier, Mr. Michaud was appointed Québec’s delegate-general to Paris. He was instrumental in promoting Montréal internationally throughout his career. In 1984, he was named Commander of the Legion of Honour, which is one of France’s highest distinctions.
During his three years at the helm of the government corporation, Mr. Michaud helped Shepherd Montréal into one of the world’s leading host cities through the use of the Palais as an essential tourism and economic development tool for the city and Québec as a whole. He was the brainchild behind many initiatives, including the Palais’ new rental policy as well as sales and marketing strategies specifically aimed at the convention market. He was also responsible for fostering collaborations and setting up partnerships with various institutions such as the Greater Montréal Convention and Tourism Bureau, the Board of Trade of Metropolitan Montreal, the city of Montréal, universities, as well as provincial and federal government agencies and rallying all of these entities behind the bidding process. It is a model that is still being used today. Finally, he signed a trade agreement with the Palais des congrès de Paris.
Mr. Michaud has made Québec’s economic and cultural prosperity a priority throughout his career.
