                          The Palais des congrès de Montréal seized its Recognition Award Gala to pay tribute to 18 Ambassadors who played an active role in bringing 12 international conventions to Montréal. These major events will generate over $85 million for the city’s economy and that of the province, as a result of the 30,000 business tourists they will attract. “Montréal has been hosting more international events than any other city in the Americas for the last four years. As for the international conventions held at the Palais, these are primarily due to the efforts of our Ambassadors in promoting our city to major international associations,” declared Raymond Larivée, President and CEO of the Palais des congrès. “Tonight, members of the tourism, business and academic communities gathered to celebrate the excellence and international reputation of a city known for being incredibly dynamic,” he added.
Eighteen new Ambassadors join the Club
The Recognition Award Gala salutes the exceptional contribution of influential and dynamic individuals from Montréal’s various segments of excellence who step outside of their usual professions to actively bring international conventions to the city, and thus help generate economic and intellectual benefits for the city and province. Since 1985, the members of the Ambassadors Club have helped attract nearly 230 large-scale events to Montréal, which have contributed almost $1 billion to the city’s and province’s economy. “Securing an international convention is like bidding for the Olympic Games. It would be impossible to achieve without the involvement of our 300 current members or those on the path to membership,” said Dr. Pavel Hamet, President of the Palais Ambassadors Club.

Grand Ambassador Award
A special Grand Ambassador Award was also presented to Yves Michaud, whose dedication, leadership and career have significantly contributed to Montréal’s international reputation. The President and CEO of the Palais des congrès de Montréal from 1984 to 1987 and the founder of the Ambassadors Club, Mr. Michaud was instrumental in making Montréal one of the world’s top business destinations through the use of the Palais as an essential tourism and economic development tool for the city and Québec as a whole.
Emerging star researchers honoured
Mr. Rémi Quirion, Chief Scientist of Québec, also seized the event to honour three Étudiants-chercheurs étoiles (star student researchers) from Fonds de recherche du Québec. The competition makes it possible to recognize the excellent research being conducted by students and to foster research careers within Québec.

Funding for prospective and emerging Ambassadors
Palais President and CEO Raymond Larivée seized the gala affair to announce the creation of Bourse Relève, a scholarship fund aimed at encouraging researchers to get involved in attracting international conventions to Montréal, to be hosted at the Palais. Jointly administered by the Fonds de recherche du Québec and the Ambassadors Club, the fund will reward student researchers who actively embrace undertaking such as endeavour, and thus help generate significant intellectual benefits in the process.
