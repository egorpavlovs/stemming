    Thanks to the hard work and determination of James J. Clark, a professor at the McGill Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Director of its Centre for Intelligent Machines, and of Marc-André Gemme, a member of the Palais des congrès de Montréal’s business development team, 6,000 delegates will be converging in Montréal in October 2021 for the IEEE Computer Society’s International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV). This major international conference, which is expected to translate into 16,800 room nights for the city’s hotels, will generate an estimated $12.7 million in tourism revenues for Montréal and Québec. This large-scale high-tech event is the 3rd artificial intelligence (AI) conference the Palais des congrès has announced in the last 3 months, news that confirms the city’s expertise and global standing in the field of AI.
A committee packed with luminaries
What tilted the balance in Montréal’s favour is without a doubt the quality of the organizing committee put together by Professor Clark, whose presence helped clinch the bid. This shows the importance of having a rich scientific program for a conference in a field as specialized as computer vision.
City emerging as an AI and ICT hub
With its world-renowned speakers, luminaries and advanced research centres, Montréal has become fertile ground and the quintessential setting for developing a topnotch scientific and professional program for ICCV delegates. In fact, the city enjoys the support of four major universities and is home to numerous centres specializing in fundamental and applied research in computer vision and machine learning, and is shaping the next generation of engineers and scientists in the field. These include the McGill University Centre for Intelligent Machines, an inter-departmental group formed in 1985 to facilitate and promote research on intelligent systems. The city can also count on the reputable expertise of the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms (MILA) and the Institute for Data Valorization (Ivado), both associated with Université de Montréal, the Laboratory for Imagery, Vision and Artificial Intelligence (LIVIA) of the ÉTS school of engineering, Concordia University’s Centre for Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence (CENPARMI), and the Computer Research Institute of Montréal (CRIM).
