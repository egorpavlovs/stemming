                          The Palais des congrès de Montréal and Montréal InVivo have decided to unite their efforts for the purpose of attracting even more health and life science related major international conventions to Montréal and the Palais. This new partnership will not only mean significantly more initiatives aimed at bringing new large-scale events to the city, but also more economic and intellectual benefits as a result. Innovation will be fostered, along with the ongoing development of businesses and organizations operating in both of these key economic sectors in Montréal and Québec.
Montréal InVivo, the economic development organization whose membership spans 600+ organizations, including 150 research centres and 80 world-class company affiliates, is dedicated to the creation of a business environment that fosters innovation and growth within organizations in the life sciences and health sector. For its part, the Palais des congrès de Montréal, together with its 287-member Ambassadors Club, is constantly active securing major events for the Palais in order to generate even more economic and intellectual benefits.
“We firmly intend to give our city’s leading economic sectors the opportunity to take full advantage of these major international meetings,” said Raymond Larivée, President and CEO of the Palais des congrès de Montréal, a Québec government corporation. “On average, 37% of the events held at the Palais in the last 5 years have been in connection with the health and life sciences sector. This collaboration with Montréal InVivo will enable both organizations to draw from their respective strengths in order to ultimately attract even more major conventions and promote the LSHT cluster worldwide,” he added.
“Life sciences and health represent a booming sector, not to mention their contribution to the GDP, the new small businesses and the constantly growing number of jobs they’re creating. Montréal ranks 6th in North America for concentration of LSHS jobs,” mentionned Frank Béraud, Chief Executive Officer of Montréal InVivo. “This partnership is a natural fit with Montréal InVivo’s mission of bolstering the sector’s competitiveness and growth in the Greater Montréal Area and Québec-wide,” he continued.
The new partnership will span various forms, including information sharing and convention selection, and also continuing the work of putting together a new health related Montréal convention for 2016: the first ever International Congress on Personalized Health Care.
