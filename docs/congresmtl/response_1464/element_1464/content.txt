                          From July 10 to October 12, 2015, the Palais des congrès de Montréal will be hosting the world première of Michelangelo’s Sistine Chapel exhibition in its Espace 1001 venue dedicated to blockbuster extended-run shows.
Over 100,000 visitors are expected to attend the prestigious 3-month exhibition, which virtually draws you inside the iconic Italian Renaissance masterpiece. They will be able to admire up close and personal all of the technique and symbolism of Michelangelo’s famous ceiling frescoes reproduced photographically using state-of-the-art technology.
“Strategically located in the heart of Montréal, directly linked to the metro system and accessible via a variety of transportation networks, the Palais des congrès de Montréal’s Espace 1001 constitutes a prestigious venue for extended-run exhibitions seeking the natural hustle and bustle of the downtown core,” declared Raymond Larivée, President and CEO of the Palais des congrès de Montréal. “We’re thrilled to be hosting this world première which will surely wow the thousands of visitors expected to come admire these frescoes in detail like never before,” added Chrystine Loriaux, the Palais des congrès Director of Marketing and Communications.
“It is an honour for us to share Michelangelo’s signature masterpiece with the Québec population. Those who already visited the Sistine Chapel will be able to enjoy the works of art from a new perspective. Those who never saw the original paintings will be intrigued and eventually inspired to visit the Sistine Chapel one day,” mentioned Martin Biallas, CEO, Special Entertainment Events Inc. and the exhibition’s promoter.
Visitors attending Michelangelo’s Sistine Chapel exhibition will also have the opportunity to discover the products and services available at the Galeries du Palais, where dozens of merchants are always conveniently open for tourists in the downtown core and Old Montréal, rain, snow or shine!
