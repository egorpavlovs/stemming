                          The Montréal International Auto Show which starts tomorrow will mark the 15th anniversary for the major consumer show at the Palais des congrès de Montréal. During the course of the 15 years, the Show and Palais team saw over 2.5 million visitors attend what constitutes the automotive event of the year for Montréalers and literally the province’s largest consumer show. More than 200,000 visitors are expected to converge on the Palais from January 20 to 29. The Show will take over nearly all of the Palais’ venues.
“It is a real pleasure for our team to contribute to the success of the Auto Show year after year, and to welcome automotive enthusiasts from all over the province, and in the process showcase the expertise of the city’s automotive professionals in an environment perfectly suited for exhibitions of this size and scope,” stated Raymond Larivée, President and CEO of the Palais des congrès de Montréal. “We are proud to have been the home of the Show and its team for the last 15 years,” added Larivée.
Logistically smooth
The Show and Palais team will be hard at work handling the more than 425 trailer and specialty trucks that will be passing through the loading dock during the setup, delivering equipment from carmakers and other exhibitors, over and above the 500 vehicles that are also expected. It is a logistical process that changes every year and has been fine-tuned since 2002! The Palais’ versatile facilities are perfect for this type of consumer show, whose sizeable booths can raise some interesting challenges installation-wise. For instance, over 600 rigging points will be required to suspend the hulking structures and decors!
The Palais, accessible and practical
Located in the downtown core, the Palais is easily accessible either by car, public transit or on foot, especially since it is directly linked to the Montréal metro system and the underground city. From the Palais car park, at the corner Chenneville and Viger, you can access the exhibition without having to set foot outside. Auto Show visitors will also have the opportunity to discover the products and services available year round at the Galeries du Palais, including the brand new Resto-bar-Code opening today!
