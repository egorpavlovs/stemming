    These few words spoken by Palais des congrès de Montréal President and CEO Marc Tremblay thoroughly captured the essence of the 2012 Recognition Award Gala… a celebration of excellence manifested in the form of the Palais’ newly appointed Ambassadors, our Québec universities’ emerging researchers, and the winner of the 2012 International Achievement Award. The Gala was also an opportunity to praise the actions of a community working together to further develop Montréal.
“Pooling our strengths together leads to more success,” declared Mr. Tremblay. “This concerted effort, this synergy between the various players is the reason why the Union of International Associations recently ranked Montréal America’s top host city for international events… Our work has made it possible to attain new heights in 2011-2012.” During a year in which the Palais hosted a record number of events, we booked over 404 events in total, or 6% more than in 2011, and 27% more than in 2010.

But the evening was about the five newly appointed Ambassadors: Dr Michel Béland, Dr Jean Gotman, Wagdi Habashi, Guy Lachapelle and Richard Villemur. Between now and 2016, the events they attracted will draw over 13,000 visitors to Montréal and generate over $34.6 million for the city’s economy, including 30,000 room nights in the city’s hotels. The 2012 Ambassadors were followed by the four star researchers – Martin-Hugues St-Laurent, Magaly Brodeur, Vincent Duchaine and Marie-France Marin – who were applauded by the crowd for winning the Ça mérite d’être reconnu! competition.

The International Achievement Award was another highlight of the evening, with the recipient, Bombardier, garnering a vibrant tribute for contributing to Montréal’s growth.
The Recognition Award Gala, which this year was Level 2 certified for sustainable event management by the BNQ standards council of Québec, was an exceptional evening that delighted the over 600 guests in attendance. The 3rd annual Rendez-vous du Savoir could not have asked for a more fitting closing event.
The « gastronomic symphony » orchestrated by the Palais for the occasion was executed by Capital Traiteur, the Sheraton Centre Montréal, the Marriott Château Champlain, the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth, the InterContinental Montréal, the Westin Montréal, the Hyatt Regency Montréal, the Hilton Montréal Bonaventure, the Delta Centre-Ville and the Ritz-Carlton.
The 2012 Recognition Award Gala was produced by id3, with the support of Tourisme Québec, the Desjardins Group, Tourisme Montréal, AVW-TELAV, Kloda Focus, Raymond Chabot Grant Thornton and CGI.
