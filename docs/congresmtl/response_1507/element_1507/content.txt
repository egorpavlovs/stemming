                        After completing a sweeping IT modernization project, the Palais des congrès de Montréal now offers organizers a vast range of event technologies capable of propelling their events to new heights and to boost their sponsorship revenue. Our specialists will guide you through the process of choosing the services best suited to your event.

Internet
Access our client portal to order this service
Unequalled telecommunications services
Since quality communications are central to any event, we operate a robust and dependable infrastructure that delivers speeds that match your needs. More than 600 access points render the Palais a wall-to-wall wi-fi zone, which means you can access high-speed internet anywhere on our premises.
We also offer: a fibre optic network, telephony services, connections for credit card transactions, and multimedia conference rooms (teleconferencing, videoconferencing, webcasts).
Free Wi-Fi
Most people need to be connected at all times wherever they are at the Palais. And when it’s free, it’s even better! Event visitors and participants at the Palais can enjoy free wi-fi along the Galeries du Palais shopping concourse, on Level 1. Simply join “Free zone gratuite Palais” from your list of available networks on your mobile device.
Pay-as-you-go wireless internet package
Need wi-fi everywhere in the Palais? Select the pay-as-you-go wireless internet package and enjoy 24h wi-fi access! Simply join “Palais des congrès” from your list of available networks on your mobile device.
Fibre optics
Available Palais-wide with a 10 Gb/s bandwith.
MONTRÉAL WIFI
Thanks to the MTL WiFi service, delegated now enjoy free high speed WiFi connection in a large zone surrounding the Palais, including in Old Montréal. This deployment will gradually expand to include other areas such as the entertainment and business districts.

Digital Display Opportunities
An array of exceptional high definition (HD) screens that are picture perfect for advertising your event and generating revenues from your sponsors. Our 90 HD 55” (140 cm) screens and our 90 sq. ft. (8.5 m2) video wall, provide you with a unique way to showcase and promote your event, but also an excellent opportunity to generate more money for your event through the reselling of ad spaces to sponsors. Our rates ensure you will enjoy an attractive ROI unlike anywhere else!
Flexible and capable of handling last-minute changes, our screens feature remarkable picture quality, and they’re a greener way to inform your participants and promote your event than print literature.
The location of the video wall in the busiest area of the Palais, near the metro exit, delivers a level of visibility that is thoroughly priceless, reaching both people visiting the Palais and regular commuters.



E-commerce client portal
Access our client portal to order your services
Organizing a consumer or trade show and wish to make the planning process for your exhibitors as effortless as possible? Our client portal, the only one of its kind in Canada, will simplify their lives by streamlining and accelerating the booking of Palais products and services.

The portal will also keep your exhibitors informed and updated on the latest developments pertaining to your event, entitle them to preferred rates and exclusive offers, and be a constant source of professional advice from the Palais team assigned to your event.
