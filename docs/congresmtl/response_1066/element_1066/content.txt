    The Palais des congrès de Montréal is in the process of a major offensive. There is a campaign afoot called Exhibitor4, and it is aimed at wooing new consumer and trade show promoters from the North-American market. Exhibitor4 focuses primarily on our facilities’ extensive flexibility and their central location directly in the heart of Montréal’s downtown, not to mention the more than 550,000 sq. ft. they now offer.
Exhibitor4 is a relationship marketing campaign that playfully uses toy building blocks to illustrate the simply irrefutable benefits of planning and hosting exhibitions at the Palais. It’s the Montréal convention centre to the power of 4, i.e. versatile spaces, a professional team, an exceptional venue and a promotional offer.
According to Marc Tremblay, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Palais, « this is the perfect time to stake our claim in the North American trade show market and take full advantage of the economic recovery. » He further adds: « The Palais is a convention centre that is ideally adapted for exhibitions looking to stand out in an environment bustling with activity. Through our incomparable service and high performing facilities, and location in the city’s downtown, our aim is to give promoters and visitors an experience they’ll want to relive. »
Bigger-than-ever exhibition space
After rethinking its use of space, the Palais now offers 551,000 sq. ft. (51,280 m2) of spaces, including nearly 500,000 sq. ft. (46,452 m2) for exhibitions in which to accommodate up to 1,950 booths in a state-of-the-art hi-tech environment featuring up to 263,000 sq. ft. of contiguous space. Consumer show promoters can now use the main lobby on Level 1 (commercial mall) for booths and take advantage of the current daily commuter traffic of 10,000 people. Promoters looking for something a little bolder can also ask about our terraces and green rooftop courtyards!
Undeniably convenient perks for promoters
The Palais is recognized as an official customs clearance point by the Canada Border Services Agency, which really simplifies things for organizers who need to move large quantities of material quickly. Also, the Palais’ 15 unloading docks and indoor waiting area capable of accommodating 10 53-foot trailer trucks at once truly facilitate the setup and takedown process.
