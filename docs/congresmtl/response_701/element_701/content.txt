Celebrating 25 years together
Twelve new conventions confirmed
Charles Lapointe named Grand Ambassador
International Recognition Award presented to Gil Rémillard
Montréal, March 19, 2008 – The 2008 Recognition Award Gala was held tonight at the Palais des congrès de Montréal in the presence of Jacques Chagnon, Second Vice-President of the National Assembly, Member for Westmount_Saint-Louis, and Gérald Tremblay, Mayor of Montréal. This year, the event marked 25 years of collaboration between the Palais and its influential partners who have contributed to its success as a veritable catalyst for the Québec economy and the enhancement of Montréal’s international reputation.
Palais President and CEO, Paul Saint-Jacques, used the occasion to underscore the importance of this collaboration in its positioning: “Montréal’s enviable positioning in the convention industry is a result of the teamwork of various partners in the tourism industry. This evening, we are delighted to celebrate this enduring 25-year alliance.” Combined, the twelve conventions obtained by Ambassadors and other partners, will attract 24,000 delegates who will spend more than 53, 000 room nights in the city. The economic spin-offs from these events are estimated at more than $55 million.
Four new Ambassadors by Appointment
In an evening that celebrated success and excellence, four new Ambassadors were honored for their voluntary contribution in securing international conventions for the Palais des congrès de Montréal. The Ambassadors by Appointment who join the 202 members of the Club this year are:
Lucie Sauvé — 5th World Environmental Educational Congress, May 2009;
René Walling — Anticipation, 67th World Science Fiction Convention, August 2009;
Jean St-Gelais — 35th Annual Conference of the International Organization of Securities Commissions, June 2010;
Michael Stinson — 21st International Congress on Acoustics, June 2013.
Ambassadors’ Club President, Dr. Jacques Corcos, pointed to the importance of their contribution: “The dynamism and dedication of Ambassadors are essential to the cultural, scientific and economic vitality of Montréal. It is important to recognize and support their efforts in the spirit of openness that is so characteristic of the Palais.”

Charles Lapointe named Grand Ambassador
The 2008 Gala also featured a special tribute with the Grand Ambassador Award, an honor bestowed by the Palais upon an individual in the tourism milieu who has demonstrated excellence. The first recipient of this award is none other than Charles Lapointe , President and CEO of Tourisme Montréal since 1989 and Chairman of the Canadian Tourism Commission since December 2002. This distinction underscores his significant contribution in promoting Montréal as a convention city.
International Recognition Award presented to Gil Rémillard
Created in 2005, the International Recognition Award honors an individual whose achievements project a positive image of Montréal around the world. The work of this year’s honoree, Gil Rémillard, has put Montréal at the forefront of leading economic thinking. In 1995, Mr. Rémillard founded the International Economic Forum of the Americas/Conference of Montréal, a non-profit organization whose primary mission is to facilitate the exchange of information and promote open discussion on major economic issues. With this outstanding achievement, Mr. Rémillard has been instrumental in advancing Montréal’s reputation on the world stage, like Normand Legault (Grand prix de F1 de Montréal), Assad Kotaite (International Civil Aviation Organization) and Alain Simard (Festival International de Jazz de Montréal), who all have received the award since 2005.
The Palais des congrès de Montréal marks its 25th anniversary
Celebrating 25 years together... The 2008 Recognition Award Gala was the ideal occasion to mark the 25th anniversary of the Palais and to look to the future with the key players involved in its development: members of its Ambassadors’ Club. Since its inception in 1983, the Palais des congrès de Montréal has hosted millions of visitors from around the world and has been centre stage for some historic and significant events like large corporate gatherings, important exhibitions and international congresses. These moments contributed to the advancement of several areas of activities, such as medical research, environment awareness and industrial development. The complete program of anniversary activities will be unveiled later in the year.
The Société du Palais des congrès de Montréal also took advantage of the occasion to present a donation to the Fondation Gérard-Delage, whose mission is to promote the advancement of competencies and knowledge in the Québec tourism industry by supporting students with professional development scholarships.
Invaluable Partners
The 2008 Recognition Award Gala is made possible thanks to the participation of its principal partner, Tourisme Québec, and of its major partners, AVW-TELAV, the Kloda Focus Group and the Salon international de l’auto de Montréal.
