    The Palais des congrès added three prestigious international awards to its list of accolades on October 24 at the Meeting Industry Marketing Awards (MIMA) in London, England.
The Palais was recognized for the excellence of its “At the Center of Everything” marketing campaign, which won in two categories: Best Direct Marketing Campaign and Best Brand Marketing Campaign.
The marketing and sales teams at the Palais earned honours of their own, walking away with an award for Best Team in recognition of their professionalism, creativity and results-oriented approach.
No stranger to international accolades, the Palais ranks among the best convention centres in the world and was nominated for the prestigious AIPC Apex Award for “World’s Best Convention Centre” in 2011 and 2012.

Elements of an Award-Winning Campaign
The “At the Center of Everything” was a direct mail campaign targeting clients in international associations based in Europe. The campaign used the concept of “proximity” built around a map of downtown Montréal, which when unfolded origami-style to reveal a series of highly stylized booklets showcasing the city’s main economic drivers. The direct mail campaign was complemented by advertising placements and e-mail communications, all featuring the bold “X” design. The European campaign was so successful that the Palais team adapted the concept for a subsequent mailing to U.S. clients.
 

Meetings Industry Marketing Awards: Recognizing Excellence
The Meetings Industry Marketing Awards (MIMA) were launched in 2002 to recognize professional excellence in marketing, sales and promotional initiatives in the meetings and events industry.
