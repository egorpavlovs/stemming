The Palais des congrès de Montréal is zooming in on the future – forward-thinking, innovative, the convention centre will serve as a platform for local knowhow as well as a gateway for Montréalers and visitors from all over the world seeking unique experiences that will leave a lifelong impression.  
Advocating for Montréal creativity
Montréal is known worldwide for its energy and “joie de vivre.” It is fertile ground for innovation. The Palais will help drive this effervescence by actively advocating for the city and its distinct brand of creativity. We generate significant economic benefits. We will also generate excitement, as only Montréal can.
 


A Palais that is future-friendly






Live to the beat of the Montréal community
The Palais invites Montréalers to make this iconic venue in the heart of the city their own. There are numerous projects afoot. Their announcement is imminent, and these projects will inspire citizens to dream and take proud ownership of their Palais. We have a truly passionate team working on this.







A showcase for local scientists and creatives
The city brims with sectors that nurture its international reputation. The Palais has a major role to play in broadening the reach of these sectors so the world can see the  incredible talent found in Montréal. And we will do this by working with local firms!







Giving visitors fascinating experiences
Our ability to generate excitement and deliver unforgettable experiences will position the Palais at the very heart of the revolution shaping the future of major events. Montréal is a host city that leaves visitors with a lasting impression, and the Palais will capture their imagination!







Helping define the convention centre of tomorrow
Montréal’s energy and creativity help it stand out on the world stage. Both of these qualities will be drawn upon as we reinvent the industry. Galvanizing the world with best practices and setting the standards of tomorrow – it is a challenge the Palais has agreed to take on, so that Montréal may continue to be the leading host city in the Americas for international events.



The Palais is in the midst of a profound transformation as it looks to re-emerge as a convention centre of the future, and you will certainly have a role to play in this process. Stay tuned, as ideas are already starting to come together!

Have a project in mind you believe might be a good fit for the Palais’ new vision?
