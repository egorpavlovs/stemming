A must-see historic area for sightseers



                        An impressive heritage
Centuries of history are on display in lovely Old Montréal. Located on the shore of the Saint Lawrence River and a few minutes from the Palais des congrès, this famous area is one of the city’s most popular attractions. Visitors are charmed by its vitality and year-round atmosphere of festivity.
Always something to see
Old Montréal is the perfect spot to start any sightseeing tour. From here you can visit magnificent Notre-Dame Basilica, stop for a bite to eat at Place Jacques-Cartier, and then head to the Pointe-à-Callière, a Museum of Archaeology and History built above the remains of the city’s first settlement. Later on, make sure to head into the Quays of the Old Port, where you’ll find a slew of activities for kids young and old!
