The city’s economic nucleus



                        Above the city
The Business district in downtown Montréal is home to the city’s economic lifeblood. This area can easily be spotted from afar thanks to its distinctive skyscrapers, such as the Tour de la Bourse, or the Place Ville Marie, designed by I.M. Pei. Many international and national headquarters are located here, contributing to Montréal’s reputation as a first-class city.
Under the city
One of downtown Montréal’s most famous features is its underground pedestrian network, dubbed the underground city. It is one of the largest underground networks in the world, allowing locals and tourists alike to navigate the downtown area without even stepping outside. It is over 32 km of underground galleries over 12 km2 and includes shopping malls, museums, restaurants, subway stops, and access to the Palais des congrès.
