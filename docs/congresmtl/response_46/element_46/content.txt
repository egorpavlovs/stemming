In the heart of Montreal's great neighborhoods



                        A recipe for success
These attractions, combined with the Palais’ reputation and service excellence, are the reasons why Montréal remains America’s leading host city for international meetings.
Everything is nearby
The Palais des congrès de Montréal is located in the heart of the city, surrounded by lively and bustling neighbourhoods, which sets it apart from so many of the world’s convention centres. Also, visitors can conveniently shop and eat at a variety of stores and restaurants right on the premises without ever setting foot outside the Palais.
Located on Level 1, the Galeries du Palais shopping promenade is home to some 20 merchants, including several cafés and restaurants, clothing boutiques, a flower shop, an eye care centre, a travel agency, a convenience store, a car rental agency, a photographer and an art gallery.
A strategic location
Conveniently located in the heart of Montréal, the Palais des congrès is only a few steps away from the city’s most popular sectors, including the business district, Chinatown, Old Montréal, and the Quartier des spectacles. You can find myriad leisure activities to enjoy nearby, as well as boutiques, theatres, and museums to visit.
