Robert Mercure assumed his new position as President and CEO of the Palais on September 4. A well-known figure in the international tourism community, Mr. Mercure has extensive experience in the hospitality industry.
“It is with great pleasure that I return to Montréal after 11 years at the helm of a Québec crown jewel, the Château Frontenac. First and foremost, let me say that I absolutely love Montréal and its energy. Our city is known for its joie de vivre and as a place where any idea can spark something big to be added to an already rich slate of events, exhibitions and festivals. Montréal is a city of opportunities, and we are fortunate to be able to count on the creativity and drive of passionate people like you to make it such an exciting spot.
I come to the Palais with a headful of new ideas. As you know, the exhibition market is in the midst of a transformation, and staking your claim now requires the ability to generate surprise, think outside the box, and provide visitors with a genuine experience. Let’s be bold together! Our seasoned staff is eager to hear your daring ideas, and they will work alongside you doing everything they can to make them happen. Creativity is a gem that helps events grow, and we are ready to contribute to your success.”

	Changes at the Palais: Renée Langlois takes over from Catherine Paul!

		Palais des congrès de Montréal
					
    
    The Palais team would like to congratulate Renée Langlois, recently named Associate Director for Business Development. Ms. Langlois has worked at the Palais for the last six years and has plenty of experience in event management. She is now responsible for exhibition accounts.
“We have the tremendous privilege of working with loyal customers who are well known for their creativity and drive. Helping them succeed is a pleasure for me and my team,” said Langlois.
The exhibition market alone generated $47 million in tourism dollars for Montreal and the province in 2017–2018!
After serving as Associate Director for Business Development for eight years and a total of 15 years at the Palais, Catherine Paul has decided to take on new challenges in her career. We wish her every success in her future endeavors. During her time at the Palais, she saw 729 public and private exhibitions come and go and impressed her co-workers with her ability to bring people together and her can-do approach. Thank you for everything!

	Experient Supplier of the Year Nominee

	 
		communications
		Conventions, Palais des congrès de Montréal
					
    
    The Palais’ event managers work as suppliers to numerous professional convention organizers (PCO) throughout the year to set up their events at the Palais. They develop working relationships and form one-off teams to contribute to the success of the event.
To recognize the outstanding job done by their suppliers who continually goes above and beyond, Experient, a global meeting and events management company, has developed the Supplier of the Year award process. The Experient Supplier of the Year Awards are based on several criteria:

Making an extraordinary contribution to Experient and their clients’ success
Displaying outstanding character and integrity
Displaying ongoing excellence in their job—responsiveness, problem‑solving skills, etc.
Sharing in our vision of continuing to perfect the event experience by demonstrating continued excellence in their job

In 2017, our very own Karine Plamondon was nominated for the title. Here is what an Experient team member had to say about Karine’s work:
“I have had the pleasure of working with Karine three different times over the last 10 years. Each experience has been exceptional, she is more than willing to go above and beyond for you and your group. She completely understands who Experient is and respects the relationship we have with our clients. Every convention center has their own unique rules and regulations and the Palais des congrès is no different. What makes them different is having a convention service manager like Karine to personally walk you through these regulations and help find ways to make them work for your individual groups. She makes sure all departments are giving high levels of customer service, helps negotiate internal costs in order to stay within the client’s budget, and is a great resource when contracting external suppliers. It is very rare to work with the same individual each time you return to a location (especially over a period of 10 years) but that is what I have had the pleasure of doing. I love knowing that when I return to Montreal, I’ll be working once again with a great partner and dear friend!” – Kim Rhodes, Senior Meeting and Event Manager
Congratulations Karine and keep up the good work!

	Big names, big crowds

	 
		communications
		Conferences, meetings and galas, Palais des congrès de Montréal
					
    
    The Palais des congrès de Montréal recently hosted some big names, which in turn drew big crowds. When the likes of Barack or Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton or the Aga Khan are in town, you can count on a sizeable audience!
Michelle Obama’s speech in February drew the biggest crowd ever assembled in one room at the Palais: 10,200 people. Nearly 12,000 people gathered to hear the Aga Khan in November.
Strategic security measures
Ensuring the safety of such high-profile speakers is naturally a top priority. The key to doing it successfully resides in the different police forces and the event organizers working together. When everyone’s needs are attended to and operations are coordinated accordingly, things unfold as planned logistically.
Crowd management
The other challenge for events like these is managing the crowd. Everyone attending must go through a security screening, have their tickets validated, and find their seats – all within a very short time span. Good communication and attentive service are essential here for the experience to be a memorable one for all participants.
The U.S. Secret Service saluted the work of the Palais security team for the security plan they drafted and deployed when the American dignitaries visited.
Each event, big or small, needs to be meticulously planned and deserves our attention so that it can live up to the expectations of those organizing it, and participating in it.

	It’s about furnishing an experience

	 
		communications
		Hi-tech environment, Palais des congrès de Montréal
					
    
    A convention centre’s entrance halls and atria, pre-function spaces and corridors are an integral part of the event spaces, but sometimes they just look and feel… rudimentary. Not at the Palais des congrès de Montréal, where we dress and configure them to enrich the experience for participants and also optimize the flow and productivity of the event.
In February 2018, we outfitted the various common areas spanning levels 5 and 7 of the Palais with new furnishings to foster interaction, networking and comfort during breaks for both the delegates and organizers of the event.
Modern, colourful and functional, the items include communal tables equipped with power outlets, privacy armchairs, ottomans and benches to promote wellbeing, meetings or teleworking.
Take a few minutes to rest and use the solar energy to refuel before your next conference!
