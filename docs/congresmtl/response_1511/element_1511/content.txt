    White Sausage Cocktail Puffs
Celery Root Mousseline with Thyme and Sautéed Onions and Apples
Simon Devost-Dulude, executive chef at Capital Catering, offers us a recipe to add colours and new flavors in our plates.
This hot canapé delight is perfect for fall, and if you switch the apples with cranberries and the thyme with rosemary, it’s also ideal for the Holidays. To serve as an appetizer, simply increase the portions and top with a slightly tangy green salad.
 
1 pack          store-bought puff pastry (you can use the discarded remnants to make cheese straws, among other things)
1 sausage      good-quality fully cooked white sausage (sold in most butcher and deli shops, otherwise replace with a mild fine herb sausage, for example)
1                 celery root, good size
1                 small bunch fresh thyme
1                 clove garlic
½               onion, large
50 ml         vegetable oil
250 ml       35% cream
…                 salt and pepper to taste
½                onion, large
2                  Cortland apples
25 ml          vegetable oïl
…                 salt and pepper to taste
Spread the puff pastry sheet flat and cut into 5 cm squares. Prick with a fork and oven cook as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Set aside.
Slice sausage into rounds 1 cm thick, and set aside.
For the mousseline, peel the celery root, chop the garlic and mince the onion. Sauté over medium low heat in vegetable oil, without browning. Add thyme twigs and cream, and let cook gently uncovered. The cream will reduce and thicken. If the cream reduces way before the celery root is ready, compensate by adding a little hot water. Season with salt and pepper. Once the celery root is tender, remove the thyme and put in blender until smooth. Adjust the seasoning if needed.
Mince the remaining half-onion and cut the apples into small cubes. Pan sauté in vegetable oil over high heat. Season and set aside.
Assemble by putting a spoonful of mousseline on top of each puff pastry square, adding a white sausage round and finishing with some sautéed onions and apples. Put in a very hot oven a few minutes and serve immediately, together with a sparkling cider, for instance.
For a more decadent version, add some cheese on each square before putting in oven. A brie or camembert would be perfect, or perhaps even a morbier cheese, and for something stronger tasting, try a raclette cheese.
Bon appétit!
