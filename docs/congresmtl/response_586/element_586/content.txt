	A colorful space for talking about death without taboos

    For the first End-of-Life Trade Show, an event bringing together funeral industry stakeholders and end-of-life planning professionals, the organizers have chosen as their venue Palais des Congrès de Montréal, a cheerful space well suited to the exchange of ideas.
The 5,000 or so people expected to attend will have a chance to learn about a variety of end-of-life topics. Experts, presenters, and workshops will support attendees as they contemplate these sensitive but important issues.
Creating a backdrop to encourage openness and acceptance
Talking about death or even uttering the word can plunge us into a feeling of withdrawal or distress. The organizers are faced with the significant challenge of creating an atmosphere that will encourage people to share their experience and engage in informed dialogue.
To meet that challenge, they have tasked GES with decorating the various exhibition spaces, one of which is the ritual zone. Created with the show’s main partner, Urgel Bourgie-Athos, this zone will immerse attendees in five different environments to give them insight into the rituals of different cultures.
In addition, the Mémoria Wishing Tree, a giant structure measuring 12 feet in diameter and 15 feet tall, created entirely by GES, will give attendees an opportunity to write down a wish and add it to those of other attendees throughout the show.
Come and see for yourself on November 3 and 4. We have plenty more surprises in store.
