                                        The Palais simply sizzles in winter. Now is peak season for fairs and shows that draw hundreds of thousands of visitors. It's also the time of year when we work hard to attract new events for future seasons. 
                                 
                                 
                                 
                             
                                        
                                        
                                        
                                        
                                        The best way to keep warm is to be active. It's the credo the Palais team rigorously lives by. Numerous consumer fairs and shows, sales and promotional efforts to drum up new business, and the beat goes on…

12 new international conventions and 6 national conventions confirmed
The Palais ended the year on a high note by securing, with the collaboration of its partner Tourisme Montréal, 12 new international conventions and six national conventions during the quarter ending December 31, 2010, which will generate over $72 million for Montréal's economy. The events will result in nearly 55,585 room nights being booked in hotels across the city.
