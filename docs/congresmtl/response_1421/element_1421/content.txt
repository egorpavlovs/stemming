    The Ambassadors Club added to their ranks at the 2018 Recognition Award Gala, a lively evening attended by Québec Minister of Tourism Caroline Proulx. The 18 newly minted members honoured on November 8 were appointed as Ambassadors for their active involvement in bringing an international conference to the Palais. The 12 major events these Ambassadors helped secure will generate over $73 million in economic benefits for Montréal and Québec thanks to the 32,000 business tourists they will attract and who will book 88,000+ room nights in the city’s hotels. The Ambassadors Club’s membership has now grown to 327 inspiring women and men.
The Recognition Award Gala salutes the exceptional contribution of influential and dynamic figures from the key segments of excellence of Montréal’s economy, who step outside of their usual professions to actively bring international conferences to the city, and thus help generate significant economic and intellectual benefits for the city and province.

    The prestigious Multisector Strategic Taskforce made up of leaders from eight of Montréal’s key economic sectors held its first meeting on October 10. On the agenda for these seasoned executives were the strategies that need to be implemented to abet the process of bringing international conferences to Montréal, as well as topics specifically related to their respective fields. Ambassadors Club President Professor Hany Moustapha opened the meeting, during which the participants elaborated on the reasons behind the need for a taskforce that groups together representatives from Montréal’s key research hubs and main industry clusters.
The purpose of this recently formed committee of well-known influencers is to further entrench Montréal’s leadership in the eight sectors of the economy represented on the taskforce.

	From good idea to making it happen: Putting together a consumer show

	 
		communications
		Exhibitions and tradeshows
					
    
    * Translated from the article that appeared in the May issue of ExpoMag
People who have a passion for something, anything, always welcome the opportunity to share it with their peers at a consumer show. Attending conferences, going around gathering samples and literature, meeting fans or stars, and dressing up as your favourite character are all part of the fun associated with these collective experiences.
Often, when no such event exists, these same people set about creating one, which spells good news for consumer show fans everywhere! Whether it’s about being active, hobbies, or interests like the environment or the outdoors, all subject matters and new trends have the potential to trigger events that draw crowds.
Just as often, these future event promoters lack event planning and organizing expertise, so getting the right support becomes essential. Thankfully, help is available from a variety of sources, e.g. tourism offices, convention and exhibition centres, or service providers like audiovisual or decoration companies. Organizing an event is about teamwork, and the parties involved are always happy to play a role in the process of shaping a new initiative.
LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION
If you want your event to be well attended, it needs to be accessible. Based on the consumers you want to attract, determine whether you need to consider parking, public transit, or both! Will there be heavy or large-size items on the exhibition floor? If yes, find a venue with high ceilings and check the floor’s load bearing capacity. If you’re looking to organize a green event, make sure the venue is certified to provide green services.

Event space providers are often equipped with tools designed to shepherd new promoters through the development of their project. This includes information on the various steps of starting up an event. E.g. event promoters are required to be duly incorporated under provincial or federal law. Foreign firms must be duly registered in their country of origin. Starting up your event requires, among other things:

Determining:

when you’d prefer to hold your event (make room for a few options)
which days of the week
room requirements: how many and what size
room setup: theatre-style, classroom-style, etc.
the type of 10 x 10 booths
the estimated number of days required: setup, exhibition, takedown


Assessing the number of exhibitors – Defining the event’s structure:

Exhibition only
Exhibition with conferences/workshops
Exhibition with demonstrations
Exhibition with food concessions


Settling on a ticketing system:

No ticketing service
Onsite box office only
Onsite box office and online ticketing service


Reading and learning about the venue you are interested in, e.g. information found on their website
Determining your overall budget, including the venue rental

Using this as your general outline of the event you’d like to host, you can now move on to finding your venue, and when warranted, scheduling visits so you can scout the venues and pick the right one.

Once you’ve fleshed out the general idea of the event, found your venue and started the process of finalizing the programming, it’s time to tackle logistics and publicity. More specifically:

Ascertaining your needs in terms of:

services (rigging, plumbing, electricity, merchandise handling, etc.)
staff, i.e. greeters, coat check
internet (organizers, exhibitors, visitors)
audiovisual (projection, sound, etc.)
food services (organizers, exhibitors, visitors)
ticketing
visibility


Looking into sponsorship revenue opportunities

LET’S TALK BUDGET
Sound planning is the key to booking an event without losing your shirt! There are many expenses to consider, but also numerous revenue sources you can tap into. Seize every opportunity out there. Renting the space in which to host your exhibition will definitely constitute your biggest expense. Make sure you ask which services are included in the rental fee. Often, the fee will include offices for the event’s promoter, registration or storage areas, building security and housekeeping services. Below are some of the costs that need to be factored in, by either the party renting the space or the suppliers working the event:

Labour for room setups
Rigging
Electricity hookups
Plumbing
Coat check
Security
Nurse’s/First aid station
Housekeeping (during and post event)
Telecommunications and internet services
Ticketing and greeting services (operating expenses and/or royalties)
Food and beverage
Audiovisual (microphone, screen, projector, staff, etc.)
Decoration (booth, handling, labour, etc.)
Parking
Lodging
Advertising and graphic design services
Speakers, host, spokesperson
Customs clearance
Transportation (deliveries, travel expenses, storage fees)

REVENUE OPPORTUNITIES
The list of expenses might seem long, but the range of possible revenue sources is also quite extensive, e.g. participant registration fees, signups for specific activities, booth rentals for exhibitors, sponsorship plan, merchandising, subsidies/grants or other funding operations.
Take the time to inquire about the advertising opportunities the venue offers. For instance, some venues are equipped with event technology organizers can use to not only promote their event but also sell ad space to sponsors and generate some serious income. Wi-fi access portals, dynamic signage, poster displays – a multitude of possibilities. All you need is a little creativity to provide both your sponsors and visitors with an exceptional experience. When you integrate sponsors and exhibitors in your communication plan, they become allies in spreading the word about your event to as many people as possible.

SHIFT INTO ACTION MODE
Once you’ve hammered out your needs and drafted your budget, next is making your event happen. Here, the support of a dedicated event manager assigned to your event by the event venue can make all the difference in terms of advising you throughout the logistical planning process. Your manager will liaise with team members and service providers to ensure everything runs smoothly every step of the way during the setup, the actual event, and the post-event takedown. Your manager also knows the venue inside out, so s/he will be able to recommend creative ways of using the event spaces at your disposal. Think of your manager’s knowledge of the premises as a Pinterest board you can draw inspiration and practical solutions from. Also, make sure the venue assigns someone to the exhibition floor during the event, to handle last-minute adjustments.
POST MORTEM
After the event, once everyone has slept a few hours, it is essential that you perform a thorough review of the experience and take stock of what went right and what could be improved upon, for the next edition of your event. Also, take the time to reply to the satisfaction surveys from your sponsors and suppliers, to give them the opportunity to improve how they do things as well. Proper feedback facilitates the process of tweaking your operations to better meet your customers’ needs.
Is putting together an event a lot of work? Of course. But the sight of thousands of visitors sharing a common interest and experience, eager for new information, instantly makes it all worthwhile. Teamwork, sponsors, suppliers – they all make everything so much easier. The support is there, avail yourself of it by developing ties that will foster success!

	A colorful space for talking about death without taboos

	 
		communications
		Exhibitions and tradeshows
					
    
    For the first End-of-Life Trade Show, an event bringing together funeral industry stakeholders and end-of-life planning professionals, the organizers have chosen as their venue Palais des Congrès de Montréal, a cheerful space well suited to the exchange of ideas.
The 5,000 or so people expected to attend will have a chance to learn about a variety of end-of-life topics. Experts, presenters, and workshops will support attendees as they contemplate these sensitive but important issues.
Creating a backdrop to encourage openness and acceptance
Talking about death or even uttering the word can plunge us into a feeling of withdrawal or distress. The organizers are faced with the significant challenge of creating an atmosphere that will encourage people to share their experience and engage in informed dialogue.
To meet that challenge, they have tasked GES with decorating the various exhibition spaces, one of which is the ritual zone. Created with the show’s main partner, Urgel Bourgie-Athos, this zone will immerse attendees in five different environments to give them insight into the rituals of different cultures.
In addition, the Mémoria Wishing Tree, a giant structure measuring 12 feet in diameter and 15 feet tall, created entirely by GES, will give attendees an opportunity to write down a wish and add it to those of other attendees throughout the show.
Come and see for yourself on November 3 and 4. We have plenty more surprises in store.

	The Montreal Vegan Festival Comes to Palais des Congrès

	 
		communications
		Exhibitions and tradeshows
					
    
    For its fifth anniversary, the Montreal Vegan Festival is headed to Palais des Congrès de Montréal. The organizers of the exhibition, slated for October 20 and 21, 2018, have put their trust in the Palais experts for the event, which will bring together thousands of vegans, vegetarians, foodies, and anyone curious about a vegan diet.
The Montreal Vegan Festival has been a success since its very first year and has quickly become an event not to be missed. About 18,000 attendees are expected to come and mingle with some 155 exhibitors who will be showcasing the health, ethical, and environmental aspects of veganism. In addition, lectures and workshops are available to anyone interested.
You might think that a big-name sponsor must be behind such a successful event, but actually, all the credit goes to a group of about ten volunteers with a shared passion.
For Sabrina Watelle, the event’s general manager, it is important to make the exhibition as accessible as possible. That’s why admission is free to the public. In exchange, Watelle and her team are ready to work as many as 30 hours a week as volunteers, over and above their regular jobs, to make sure the Vegan Festival meets your expectations.
This public exhibition is proof that with a good idea and a strong team, anything is possible. Come and check it out! From now on, the organizers can count on our team of experts for support and advice.

	Changes at the Palais: Renée Langlois takes over from Catherine Paul!

	 
		communications
		Palais des congrès de Montréal
					
    
    The Palais team would like to congratulate Renée Langlois, recently named Associate Director for Business Development. Ms. Langlois has worked at the Palais for the last six years and has plenty of experience in event management. She is now responsible for exhibition accounts.
“We have the tremendous privilege of working with loyal customers who are well known for their creativity and drive. Helping them succeed is a pleasure for me and my team,” said Langlois.
The exhibition market alone generated $47 million in tourism dollars for Montreal and the province in 2017–2018!
After serving as Associate Director for Business Development for eight years and a total of 15 years at the Palais, Catherine Paul has decided to take on new challenges in her career. We wish her every success in her future endeavors. During her time at the Palais, she saw 729 public and private exhibitions come and go and impressed her co-workers with her ability to bring people together and her can-do approach. Thank you for everything!
