                          The Palais des congrès de Montréal recently unveiled the four pillars of its new vision predicated on becoming a leading advocate for Montréal and its unique brand of creativity. This vision will be reflected in the innovative projects being rolled out in the coming weeks – initiatives that will benefit Montréalers as well as convention-goers and visitors from all over the world visiting the Palais.
“The Palais des congrès de Montréal is at the heart of a city recognized worldwide for being dynamic and creative. Our venue serves as a gateway to the city for thousands of international visitors, and we firmly intend to use this as a means of introducing them to our local knowhow – knowhow that reflects the image and reputation of our city,” explains Robert Mercure, President and CEO of the Palais des congrès de Montréal.
The Palais des congrès plans to usher in the future by providing unique experiences that will leave a lasting impression on everyone. These will be made possible thanks to the talents of Montréalers who thrive on creating memorable moments for visitors seeking unique activities and experiences during their stay here.
The new vision will further confirm the Palais’ leadership role within the industry. It will also serve to position the city and the Palais among the prime host destinations for major events.
 
The four pillars of the Palais’ new vision are as follows:
1. Living to the beat of the Montréal community
The Palais will invite Montréalers to make this iconic venue in the heart of the city their own. The various initiatives that will be announced will inspire citizens to dream and take proud ownership of their Palais as a gathering place. They will get a taste of this new side of the Palais in late March.
2. Showcasing local scientists and creatives
The city brims with sectors that nurture its international reputation. The Palais has chosen to play a major role in broadening the reach of these sectors and will spotlight the incredible talent found in Montréal.
3. Giving visitors a fascinating experience
The ability to generate excitement and deliver unforgettable experiences is among the leading criteria major associations look for in potential host cities. Montréal is a destination that leaves a lasting impression, and the Palais will contribute to making the events it welcomes memorable.
4. Helping define the convention centre of tomorrow
Galvanizing the world with best practices and setting the standards of tomorrow – it is a challenge the Palais has agreed to take on, so that Montréal may continue to be the busiest host city in the Americas for international events (UIA 2017).
 
This bold vision will take shape gradually, with the help of the industry’s key players and local expertise: “All the partners agree that this vision reflects the direction the Palais must take to remain competitive and stand out on the international stage. The success of our transformation rests on the alliances we will form with local partners united in championing the city, its creatives and the various fields they represent,” concludes Robert Mercure.
