                        Prestigious, modern
The members of your association deserve the very best. Hosting your convention at the Palais des congrès de Montréal, an AIPC Quality Standards gold certified centre and a finalist for the title of World’s Best Congress Centre1, adds prestige to your event, plus the advantage of state-of-the-art facilities.
Strategically located
The Palais is easily accessible, regardless of where your participants will be arriving from:

centrally linked to Montréal’s public transit system
near numerous taxi and Bixi stands
10 minutes from the central train station
near major road arteries
20 minutes from the Pierre-Elliott-Trudeau and Saint-Hubert-Longueuil airports

The Palais also houses 1,600 parking spaces.
Your convention participants will welcome the proximity of the city’s hotels, with 4,000 rooms directly connected to the Palais, and the lively areas nearby: Old Montréal, Chinatown, the international district, the arts and entertainment district, and the healthcare district.
Modern and versatile facilities
Planning and hosting your convention at the Palais translates into a world of possibilities. You’ll enjoy access to 500,000 sq. ft. of ultramodern venues located in a sophisticated and state-of-the-art multipurpose environment.
To discover our spaces, take a look at our 360 virtual visit, or get a closer glimpse at the many panoramic 360 photos.



Also, take advantage of our vast array of event technology solutions that will propel your convention to new heights... and new revenues! That’s right, the Palais’ event technology opens the way for your event to generate new sponsorship revenues. Learn more.
Customer service — always paramount
The Palais has hosted over 5,500 events of all types and sizes since it opened in 1983. Our customer satisfaction level, which is constantly near 90%, intimately stems from our team of dedicated professionals who guide and mentor you every step of the way as you plan your event into a truly memorable affair.

Flavour-bursting menus crafted with local products — a recipe for success
The creativity and talent of Simon Devost-Dulude, Executive Chef of Capital Catering, the Palais des congrès’ exclusive caterer, will make the food you serve at your convention truly original and beyond your and your guests’ expectations! The Capital Catering team will advise you based on your needs and the local products in season, in order to create a personalized Montréal-flavoured menu that will simply wow your guests.

In addition, Chef Devost-Dulude has prepared five « Aliments du Québec au menu », certified dishes as part of a program aimed at promoting locally grown products, which you can also add to your menu for your guests to experience.

Environmentally minded
A pioneer in sustainable practices and measures, the Palais offers a range of green event planning and hosting packages jointly designed with the Conseil québécois des événements écoresponsables.
