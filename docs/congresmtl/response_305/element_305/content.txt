Montréal: A climate that is as diverse as its citizens



                        Seasonal swings
Montréal experiences all four seasons, which means weather changes are not uncommon, especially during the transition months. Our winters can get cold but our summers are warm!
Activities for every month
Check the forecast before packing to see what the weather will be like while you visit Montréal. You can plan your activities accordingly because we like to take full advantage of our different seasons and you’re sure to find something to do in the city and its surroundings, no matter the weather!
