                          The Palais des congrès de Montréal and the Canadian Honey Council will be hosting Apimondia 2019, the Apicultural Congress of the International Federation of Beekeepers' Associations. The event will attract over 6,500 delegates from all over the world to Montréal, which will generate 18,000 room nights in the city’s hotels and over $17,000,000 for Montréal’s and Québec’s economy. The top host city in the Americas1 for international events for a fourth consecutive year and Gold Quality Standards certified by the AIPC, Montréal and the Palais are both well positioned internationally, while continuing to create significant economic and intellectual wealth for all of Québec.
“The competition is such that it renders the bidding process aimed at bringing international conventions of this scope to Montréal more complex. The Palais and its partners rolled out a series of strategic actions in order to persuade Apimondia’s 123 voting members that Montréal and the Palais were their best choice for hosting a successful congress in 2019,” indicated Raymond Larivée, President and CEO of the Société du Palais des congrès de Montréal, “The decision in Korea was a victory for the Canadian scientific community and beekeeping stakeholders, and everyone at the Palais is proud to have actively participated in this victory, for Montréal, Québec and Canada,” he added.
Mobilized beekeeping community
The support from the Canadian beekeeping community was instrumental in winning Apimondia 2019 for Montréal. Pierre Giovenazzo, President of the Bid Committee and Apiculture Researcher at the Deschambault animal science research centre, stated: “Canada is a global leader in apiculture research and development. We have so much to share with the world’s beekeeping community.” As for Rod Scarlet, Executive Director of the Canadian Honey Council, he added: “Canada stands out because of the wide variety and volume of honey we produce, which set us apart from other prospective host cities in the running.”
Beekeepers and businesses like Miels d’Anicet, InterMiel, HoneyWater, Nixon Honey and Sleeman Honey Brown played an active role in securing this prestigious event and lent their support by showcasing some of the products at Apimondia 2015, held in Daejeon, South Korea. The bid was also possible thanks to the financial participation of the Canadian Association of Professional Apiculturists, the Fédération des apiculteurs du Québec and the Caisses populaires Desjardins.
An unforgettable convention experience
Carmen Pierce, a 3rd-generation beekeeper from Canberra, Australia, was recently in Daejeon for Apimondia 2015. “My family and I very much enjoyed the Apimondia and think we will use attending the conferences as an excuse to travel more. It was lovely to see the city decorated in Apimondia banners and flags. It was welcoming and fun,” she said about her trip. Thousands of researchers and beekeepers like her will have the opportunity to discover Montréal in September 2019, and of course participate in enriching workshops and conferences: “We are constantly aspiring to produce excellent honey, so hearing the latest information about how to do this was incredibly helpful and interesting. Some of the ‘new research’ we already knew from our family experience with beekeeping of nearly 100 years. So the conference also gave me, and other members of my family who attended, a sense of pride to have our family traditions confirmed by some research.”
About the Palais des congrès de Montréal
Recipient of the AIPC Gold Quality Standards certification, the highest in the convention industry, and shortlisted by the International Association of Congress Centres for its World’s Best Congress Centre award, the Palais des congrès de Montréal attracts and hosts conventions, exhibitions, conferences, meetings and other events, and generates major economic benefits for Québec. www.congresmtl.com
About the Canadian Honey Council
The Canadian Honey Council (CHC) is the national organization of the beekeeping industry, representing 8,000 apiculturists across Canada. Founded in 1940, the CHC provides a forum where producers, packers, professionals, provincial associations and officials from different levels of government can talk and recommend action in the best interests of the Canadian honey bee industry. www.honeycouncil.ca
