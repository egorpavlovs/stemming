	Hany Moustapha at helm of Innovation 4.0 Hub

	 
		communications
		Ambassador’s Club
					
    
    Ambassadors Club President Prof. Hany Moustapha was recently promoted to lead the Innovation 4.0 Hub and awarded the Siemens Research Chair of Industry 4.0 Technology Integration, two initiatives inaugurated by the ÉTS school of engineering last November.
These new functions will provide the Emeritus Ambassador with opportunities to position  Montréal as a global leader in Industry 4.0 technology research, and Industry 4.0 education thanks to the 50+ professors associated with the Innovation 4.0 Hub.

Timelier than ever, the Hub, aimed at better meeting Industry 4.0 requirements in five key sectors – aerospace, energy, health and safety, construction and ground transportation – will enable our businesses to remain competitive through technological advancements.  The Hub will focus on seven major research areas:

the internet of things
big data
systems integration
additive and intelligent manufacturing
augmented and virtual reality
autonomous systems
computer security

The Siemens Research Chair of Industry 4.0 Technology Integration is the first major project of the Innovation 4.0 Hub. Co-funded by the NSERC and Mitacs, it is Canada’s first industrial chair dedicated to Industry 4.0, bringing together the expertise of 20 professors from ÉTS, Concordia University and McGill University.
With Hany Moustapha heading both of these initiatives, Montréal and Québec are very likely to shine on the world stage!

    The Ambassadors Club added to their ranks at the 2018 Recognition Award Gala, a lively evening attended by Québec Minister of Tourism Caroline Proulx. The 18 newly minted members honoured on November 8 were appointed as Ambassadors for their active involvement in bringing an international conference to the Palais. The 12 major events these Ambassadors helped secure will generate over $73 million in economic benefits for Montréal and Québec thanks to the 32,000 business tourists they will attract and who will book 88,000+ room nights in the city’s hotels. The Ambassadors Club’s membership has now grown to 327 inspiring women and men.
The Recognition Award Gala salutes the exceptional contribution of influential and dynamic figures from the key segments of excellence of Montréal’s economy, who step outside of their usual professions to actively bring international conferences to the city, and thus help generate significant economic and intellectual benefits for the city and province.

    The prestigious Multisector Strategic Taskforce made up of leaders from eight of Montréal’s key economic sectors held its first meeting on October 10. On the agenda for these seasoned executives were the strategies that need to be implemented to abet the process of bringing international conferences to Montréal, as well as topics specifically related to their respective fields. Ambassadors Club President Professor Hany Moustapha opened the meeting, during which the participants elaborated on the reasons behind the need for a taskforce that groups together representatives from Montréal’s key research hubs and main industry clusters.
The purpose of this recently formed committee of well-known influencers is to further entrench Montréal’s leadership in the eight sectors of the economy represented on the taskforce. The taskforce will also play a role in supporting the Palais in its efforts to sway international associations in the process of considering where to hold their next conference.
Our thanks, once again, to the members of this prestigious taskforce:

Suzanne Benoît, President of Aéro Montréal
Frank Béraud, Chief Executive Officer of Montréal InVivo
Mathieu Charbonneau, Executive Director of CargoM
James J. Clark, Professor at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of McGill University
Fabrice Labeau, Interim Deputy Provost, Student Life and Learning, at McGill University
Marie Larue, Chief Executive Officer of the Institut de recherche Robert-Sauvé en santé et en sécurité du travail

    The Palais des congrès de Montréal has assembled a group of leaders representing eight of the city’s key economic sectors to form a new Multisector Strategic Taskforce. Their mission will be to establish ties with influencers who will actively contribute to attracting major international conferences to Montréal and the Palais des congrès.
Among the members sitting on this prestigious taskforce are:







Louise M. Benoît, president of Aéro Montréal
Frank Béraud, Chief Executive Officer of Montréal InVivo






Mathieu Charbonneau, Executive Director of CargoM
James J. Clark, Professor at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of McGill University






Fabrice Labeau, Interim Deputy Provost, Student Life and Learning, at McGill University
Marie Larue, Chief Executive Officer of the Institut de recherche Robert-Sauvé en santé et en sécurité du travail

The role of the vastly experienced leaders who make up the new Multisector Strategic Taskforce will be to develop and nurture ties with researchers, scientists and business executives who might be inclined to actively participate in the process of bringing large-scale international gatherings to Montréal. They will be able to mine their networks for topnotch collaborators and match them with specific conferences.
Conferences advance science
Montréal is widely recognized as a knowledge hub. The city attracts international conferences that enable local researchers and experts to interact with peers who have travelled here from every continent. The Palais des congrès de Montréal works very closely with its Ambassadors and partners to advocate for the major sectors driving the Montréal and Québec economy.

		Ambassador’s Club, Sectors of excellence
					
    
    We can never stress this enough, but hosting international conventions enables Québec’s entire scientific community to shine internationally. Over 30 years ago, the Palais introduced its Ambassadors Club to help attract and hold these events in Montréal. Your involvement is vital so that Montréal may continue to be the Number One host city in North America for international conventions. You make a difference.
We recently announced the rollout of a Multisector Strategic Taskforce, whose members will represent eight of the city’s economic sectors:

Health and life sciences;
Natural and engineering sciences;
Energy and the environment;
IT and AI;
Transportation and logistics;
Aerospace; and
Workplace health and safety.

	A new image

    When Andrée-Anne, Marc-André or Marie-France from the Palais’ business development team meet with prospective Ambassadors, first impressions are crucial. They need to quickly pitch the importance of their involvement and the quality of the support from the Palais they can look forward to every step of the process. During that crucial introduction, the prestige associated with attracting a conference to Montréal needs to be conveyed in the bat of an eye.

The Club recently gave its visual brand a makeover, with a new logo and an updated version of its explanatory leaflet. Cleaner, prestigious, distinctive and contemporary, the new image projects the powerful strength of those proudly involved in the Club.
The Ambassadors Club page on the Palais website has also been redesigned to include new content, like a videoclip featuring Ambassador Fabrice Labeau delivering a firsthand account of his experience.

    In addition to advocating for its members, the Ambassadors Club schedules activities aimed at strengthening the bond between the Club and its membership, recruiting and supporting new members, and making the most of existing networks to foster strategic alliances and continue to support Québec’s key sectors.
Now midway through the current action plan, the Palais team is proud to have surpassed its objectives, especially by giving Ambassadors increasingly more visibility. The list of achievements includes:

Advertorials in Le Devoir and Boardroom, and ads in various general and trade media
A total of 5 advertisements showcasing the work of Ambassadors Ferri Hassani, Fabrice Brunet, Wagdi Habashi, Sylvain Lanthier, Alexander Thiel and Fabrice Labeau

An awareness-raising campaign on LinkedIn
The Exchange Forum hosted jointly with the Fonds de recherche du Québec
The Ambassadors Club’s networking cocktail held during the Auto Show
The ongoing work of the Aerospace Taskforce and its succession subcommittee
Hosting the 2017 Recognition Award Gala where we introduced 9 new ambassadors and 4 star researchers
Partnerships developed with the FRQ and IRSST

By joining forces to attract major international conferences, the Palais and the Ambassadors continue to generate significant economic and intellectual wealth for Montréal and the province. Together, we are taking part in the scientific development of Montréal and promoting it internationally.
