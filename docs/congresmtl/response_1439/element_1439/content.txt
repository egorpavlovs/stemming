    The Palais team would like to congratulate Renée Langlois, recently named Associate Director for Business Development. Ms. Langlois has worked at the Palais for the last six years and has plenty of experience in event management. She is now responsible for exhibition accounts.
“We have the tremendous privilege of working with loyal customers who are well known for their creativity and drive. Helping them succeed is a pleasure for me and my team,” said Langlois.
The exhibition market alone generated $47 million in tourism dollars for Montreal and the province in 2017–2018!
After serving as Associate Director for Business Development for eight years and a total of 15 years at the Palais, Catherine Paul has decided to take on new challenges in her career. We wish her every success in her future endeavors. During her time at the Palais, she saw 729 public and private exhibitions come and go and impressed her co-workers with her ability to bring people together and her can-do approach. Thank you for everything!
