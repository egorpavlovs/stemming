The Palais: 30 years of hosting major events
A head turner thanks to its unique design, the Palais also houses a wide range of spaces capable of holding the biggest events in North America. For 30 years, the Palais has been hosting international conferences, important debates on major issues, large-scale music events and so much more!

5th International AIDS Conference (1989)
Annual Kiwanis International Convention (20,000 delegates in 1998)
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (2005)
A dozen editions of the Montréal International Auto Show

The Palais des congrès de Montréal is among the world’s key venues for meetings and gatherings. Shortlisted in 2010 and 2012 for the prestigious APEX award for World’s Best Convention Centre, the Palais continues to amaze and surprise!
Essentially, 30 years of the Palais adds up to …

5900 events
15 million visitors
$5 billion for the economy

Thirty candles on a birthday cake decorated with a track record that speaks volumes has earned the Palais the right to look to the future with optimism and confidence. The number of visitors, conferences and conventions keeps growing, to the point where we will soon reach our maximum occupancy threshold! Nevertheless, we plan on doing even more to enable Montréal to maintain its title as the top host city in America for international events!
Hence why the Québec government decided this year to reserve two sites located near the Palais for possible expansion purposes.
The future success of the Palais requires that we look carefully at all options moving forward, and that we relentless pursue our efforts aimed at attracting the biggest events to Montréal.
