    Palais customers and convention-goers are in for a thoroughly new technological experience. It’s slated for 2012, but some of the early changes are already making a difference.
The new and soon-to-be-inaugurated CISCO TelePresence is the first in a series of IT improvements. Palais customers will be able to hold meetings in a state-of-the-art environment featuring, among other things, incredibly realistic and powerful audio, video and data linkups
The Palais is also expanding its IT infrastructure’s bandwidth in order to offer its customers the best services available.
New agreement with AVW-TELAV, official supplier of the Palais
One of the reasons the Palais is able to deliver advanced tech support is the expertise of AVW-TELAV, which has been renamed the official provider of audiovisual services and equipment and simultaneous translation services. The renewed five-year agreement will see the AVW-TELAV global network play an active role in positioning the Palais internationally as one of the most technologically-driven convention centres, and will continue to capitalize on the firm’s widespread reputation to offer customers an unparalleled experience.
« With its reputation for excellence and its expanded network, AVW-TELAV is the perfect partner for supplying differentiated presentation technology solution offerings, » states Marc Tremblay, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Palais. « This strategic alliance will certainly contribute to positioning the Palais as a leader in providing convention delegates with a cutting-edge, technology-savvy environment. »
A member of the Freeman Group, which produces 10,000 special and corporate events as well as 3,000 exhibitions annually, AVW-TELAV offers a complete range of services and distinctive equipment, making it a leader in sound, lighting, staging, videoconferencing, webcasting, presentation systems, interactive audience response, multimedia productions and simultaneous translation. AVW-TELAV is also known for its sustainable technology practices, having earned, among other prizes, the Green AV award from InfoComm International, an association representing audiovisual industry professionals.
« Our passionate team has been working with the Palais des congrès de Montréal for the past six years in building solid relationships with its customers, » adds Bernard Carignan, AVW-TELAV’s Regional Director for Eastern Canada and General Manager for Montréal. « A 96% customer satisfaction rate clearly indicates that we are able to meet their needs. »
