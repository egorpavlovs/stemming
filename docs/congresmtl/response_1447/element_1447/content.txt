                          Press releases | 2018-04-20
                          
                          From April 21 to 26, 2018, human-computer interaction will receive a thorough examination during the CHI 2018 international conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems held at the Palais des congrès de Montréal. This prominent conference will attract 3,000+ delegates from 50 countries and bring in an estimated $6.7 million in tourism revenue for the city and Québec.
“Montréal hosts the most international events in all of North America and AI is a field we continue to excel in. We feel privileged to welcome these world experts and to play an active role in bringing them together, which will help generate significant intellectual wealth for the province,” stated Raymond Larivée, President and CEO of the Palais des congrès de Montréal. “The cooperation between the various industry partners, especially Tourisme Montréal, made it possible to attract this major conference, and we are eager to welcome the attendees,” added Larivée.

Widely recognized as the world’s most important showcase for human-computer interaction, CHI gathers thousands of the top researchers, scientists, and designers in the world to present their latest research, solve their hardest problems, learn new material and build their networks. Originally a small conference for psychologists interested in user interface design, the annual CHI conference has grown to include a diverse group of interaction designers, computer scientists, engineering psychologists, developers, and performing artists. CHI also addresses the organizational integration of technology, and the use of technology in all areas of life.
City known as AI and IT hub
Montréal offers a fertile setting for developing a topnotch scientific and professional program for CHI delegates. In fact, the city enjoys the support of numerous universities and centres specializing in fundamental and applied research. These include the McGill University Centre for Intelligent Machines, the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms (MILA) and the Institute for Data Valorization (Ivado), both associated with Université de Montréal, the Laboratory for Imagery, Vision and Artificial Intelligence (LIVIA) of the ÉTS school of engineering, Concordia University’s Centre for Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence (CENPARMI), and the Computer Research Institute of Montréal (CRIM).
Convention city
Montréal hosts more international events than any other city in North America, according to the rankings released by the International Congress and Convention Association. Shortlisted for the World’s Best Congress Centre award (AIPC) and the recipient of the highest quality standards certification in the industry, the Palais des congrès de Montréal enjoys the collaboration of leaders from various sectors, who in turn can count on the Palais’ experience and support. It is a synergy that continues to foster the international reputation of industries as they evolve.
