Regular visitors will be pleased to know that the Auto Show is once again offering the chance to test-drive electric, hybrid, and hydrogen vehicles—a one-of-a-kind experience. This opportunity is offered free of charge to visitors, in partnership with CAA-Québec. The Garage, an updated version of The Performance Zone, is also sure to be popular among modified car fans.

	The Palais des congrès de Montréal earns major environmental recertification

	 
		communications
		uncategorized
					
    
    The Palais des congrès de Montréal is proud to have had its BOMA BEST environmental certification renewed until 2020. This signifies that the Palais’ environmental performance and the fulfilment of its commitments have been duly recognized and certified by Canada’s largest environmental assessment and certification program.
The complexity of managing operations tied to hosting different events at different times of the day renders this recertification that much more rewarding for the Palais team. Optimizing the control of fresh air supply circulating throughout the property’s distribution system has enabled the Palais to reduce its energy consumption by almost 3%, in a building that hosts nearly 350 events a year, 900,000 visitors, and spans 1.4 million sq. ft.
A commitment entrenched in business practices
Responsible, determined and committed, the Palais des congrès de Montréal became, in 2005, one of the first convention centres in Canada to be BOMA BEST certified. The Sustainability Action Plan and Sustainable Development Policy at the core of its strategy are ensuring the viability of its commitment. Also, the Responsible Procurement Policy it recently adopted is raising awareness among the Palais’ staff, partners and suppliers about the importance of consuming, producing and purchasing responsibly.
An urban farming lab as a form of green roofing
When the Palais des congrès de Montréal opened its Urban Agriculture Lab in 2016, in collaboration with AU/Lab, an organization associated with the faculty of science and the institute of environmental science of the Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM), it became the main showcase in Québec for experimenting with and advocating for urban farming technologies and techniques.
A certifiably green host destination
Montréal and the Palais are ASTM-APEX certified (Accepted Practices Exchange) as a green convention site.
