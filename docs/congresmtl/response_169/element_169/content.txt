    About 200,000 visitors are expected at Palais des congrès de Montréal for the 76th Montreal International Auto Show, the biggest consumer show in the province! From January 18 to 27, automobile enthusiasts will flock to this year’s event, where the spotlight is on electric mobility.

New, high-voltage zone: The Generator
New for 2019 is The Generator, a zone dedicated to electric mobility. Here visitors will be able to learn more about electric products and services.
At the Hydro-Québec stage within The Generator, visitors will be able to attend a variety of general audience presentations on different facets of electric mobility. Auto Show ticket holders can attend science talks offered free of charge by Centre Délic, FLO, CAA-Québec, and Équiterre.
This new zone is a great add-on to this year’s record of 42 electric cars on display!
What’s inside the Black Box?
The mysterious Black Box is another new attraction where attendees can enter a mesmerizing immersive space to admire two of the three fastest cars in the world and an exotic car designed entirely in Québec! You won’t want to leave!
A jam-packed program for car fans
With so many new attractions in store, this year’s event is one you won’t want to miss. Regular visitors will be pleased to know that the Auto Show is once again offering the chance to test-drive electric, hybrid, and hydrogen vehicles—a one-of-a-kind experience. This opportunity is offered free of charge to visitors, in partnership with CAA-Québec. The Garage, an updated version of The Performance Zone, is also sure to be popular among modified car fans.
 
The full schedule can be found on the Montreal Auto Show website.
