    The prestigious Multisector Strategic Taskforce made up of leaders from eight of Montréal’s key economic sectors held its first meeting on October 10. On the agenda for these seasoned executives were the strategies that need to be implemented to abet the process of bringing international conferences to Montréal, as well as topics specifically related to their respective fields. Ambassadors Club President Professor Hany Moustapha opened the meeting, during which the participants elaborated on the reasons behind the need for a taskforce that groups together representatives from Montréal’s key research hubs and main industry clusters.
The purpose of this recently formed committee of well-known influencers is to further entrench Montréal’s leadership in the eight sectors of the economy represented on the taskforce. The taskforce will also play a role in supporting the Palais in its efforts to sway international associations in the process of considering where to hold their next conference.
Our thanks, once again, to the members of this prestigious taskforce:

Suzanne Benoît, President of Aéro Montréal
Frank Béraud, Chief Executive Officer of Montréal InVivo
Mathieu Charbonneau, Executive Director of CargoM
James J. Clark, Professor at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of McGill University
Fabrice Labeau, Interim Deputy Provost, Student Life and Learning, at McGill University
Marie Larue, Chief Executive Officer of the Institut de recherche Robert-Sauvé en santé et en sécurité du travail
Gilles Savard, Chief Executive Officer of IVADO

    The Palais des congrès de Montréal has assembled a group of leaders representing eight of the city’s key economic sectors to form a new Multisector Strategic Taskforce. Their mission will be to establish ties with influencers who will actively contribute to attracting major international conferences to Montréal and the Palais des congrès.
Among the members sitting on this prestigious taskforce are:







Louise M. Benoît, president of Aéro Montréal
Frank Béraud, Chief Executive Officer of Montréal InVivo






Mathieu Charbonneau, Executive Director of CargoM
James J. Clark, Professor at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of McGill University






Fabrice Labeau, Interim Deputy Provost, Student Life and Learning, at McGill University

The role of the vastly experienced leaders who make up the new Multisector Strategic Taskforce will be to develop and nurture ties with researchers, scientists and business executives who might be inclined to actively participate in the process of bringing large-scale international gatherings to Montréal. They will be able to mine their networks for topnotch collaborators and match them with specific conferences.
Conferences advance science
Montréal is widely recognized as a knowledge hub. The city attracts international conferences that enable local researchers and experts to interact with peers who have travelled here from every continent. The Palais des congrès de Montréal works very closely with its Ambassadors and partners to advocate for the major sectors driving the Montréal and Québec economy.

    We can never stress this enough, but hosting international conventions enables Québec’s entire scientific community to shine internationally. Over 30 years ago, the Palais introduced its Ambassadors Club to help attract and hold these events in Montréal. Your involvement is vital so that Montréal may continue to be the Number One host city in North America for international conventions. You make a difference.
We recently announced the rollout of a Multisector Strategic Taskforce, whose members will represent eight of the city’s economic sectors:

Health and life sciences;
Natural and engineering sciences;
Energy and the environment;
IT and AI;
Transportation and logistics;
Aerospace; and
Workplace health and safety.

    In addition to welcoming over 11 million leisure and business tourists every year, Montréal has been topping the list of North American host cities for international conferences since 2011. A knowledge and innovation hub, Montréal continues to be a premier gathering place for scientific fields and economic sectors such life sciences, AI and aerospace.
As the main venue for these large-scale events, the Palais des congrès de Montréal has been enjoying record-breaking numbers in terms of attendance and square footage used. Between 2012 and 2018, there has been an overall increase of 30% in the number of people participating in the various events. Nearly 105,000 convention-goers have attended the various conventions held, accounting for economic benefits estimated at nearly $133.5 M for Montréal and Québec.
Both certified under the AIPC Quality Standards program for management excellence and ASTM certified as a green convention site, the Palais is also shortlisted for the AIPC APEX World’s Best Congress Centre award.

	Seizing on Montréal’s expertise to predict the social impacts of Artificial Intelligence

    On March 27, 2018, the Fonds de recherche du Québec, in partnership with Université de Montréal, held a workshop at the Palais des congrès de Montréal on a project to create a world observatory on the social impacts of artificial intelligence (AI) and digital technologies. Nearly one hundred people from all of Québec’s universities were in attendance, along with representatives from government departments, civil society organizations and the AI sector.
According to the workshop organizers, all activity sectors are going to be increasingly affected by artificial intelligence. While it holds extraordinary potential to foster economic development and improve living conditions, AI also raises concerns with regard to jobs, security, democracy, ethics and the professional, social and private spheres of our lives; hence the idea to create an observatory on these social issues.
Held in November 2017, the workshop was as a follow-up to the Forum on the Socially Responsible Development of Artificial Intelligence and jointly organized with the Palais des congrès. By bringing together experts from fields ranging from pure science to the humanities and social sciences, the Forum sparked a collective discussion on the ethical and socially responsible development of AI.

The Palais des congrès de Montréal recently confirmed it will be hosting yet another major AI convention, more evidence of just how dynamically this scientific field is developing in the city. The 30th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI) will be coming in 2021 and attract nearly 3,000 experts from all over the world.
