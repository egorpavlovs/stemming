The Palais des congrès de Montréal turns 35 in May 2018. Over the years, it has hosted over 1,400 consumer and trade shows, adding up to 163,000+ exhibitors and over 10 million visitors. This has helped generate over $1.8 billion for the Québec economy! Virtually every subject has been tackled, from serious issues to more unusual fare, including horse auctions, a gardening show, a sanitation fair, and the “Palais des merveilles” exhibition.
The first exhibitions happened the month after the Palais opened in June 1983. They were “Sous-traitance Transport 1983” and “Festival de la Photo 1983,” a trade show and a consumer show, respectively. Many are those that have amassed a very long track record of hosting their event at the Palais:

The most impressive is the Motorcycle Show: 36 editions between May 1983 and May 2018
Let’s Get Married: 34 annual shows at the Palais
Salon du timbre et de la monnaie: 36 times
Expo-Prestige: 31 editions

Consumer shows and trade shows are deeply entrenched in the history of the Palais and have provided visitors with many unforgettable moments.
