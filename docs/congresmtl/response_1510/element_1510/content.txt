                        Planning a green event
The Palais des congrès cares for the environment. That’s why we’ve implemented an ambitious sustainable development plan. We are also certified BOMA-BESt from BOMA-Québec, the Canadian standard in evaluating energy and environment performance of commercial buildings. Montréal is also certified by iCompli Sustainability according to ASTM-APEX (Accepted Practices Exchange) standards, a certification that solidifies the city’s reputation as a leading destination for hosting environmentally sustainable events.
We will do everything we can to help you in your efforts to make your event energy-efficient, whether you want to sensitize your participants to their environmental impact or to obtain official certification for your event.

A well-planned event can reduce your footprint by:




Minimizing landfill use
Reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHG)
Purchasing carbon credits to offset your GHG emissions
Reducing at the source




Examples of actions that are easy to take:

Promote public transportation during the event (bus, metro, Bixi)
Limit the use of printing, favour emails and online registrations
Buy local by purchasing everything you need for your event in Montréal
Give participants a bag made from recycled material instead of a conference bag and include a reusable water bottle
Use compostable or washable dinnerware.

Types of packages offered in partnership with the Conseil québécois des évènements écoresponsables (CQEER):

EcoDiscovery GHG (Greenhouse gas)
EcoDiscovery RMM (Residual materials management)
EcoBoost = EcoDiscovery GHG + EcoDiscovery RMM
EcoSummit, to obtain official classification in accordance with Québec's ecoresponsible events standard

À la carte services

Ex: ÉcoBrigade, public transportation tickets or Bixi à la carte, GHG calculator

To plan your green event:
Download the EcoPackages document and contact one of our event organizers who will propose a personalized plan to help you reach your objectives.
