	Your electric car is welcome at the Palais!

    Did you know the Palais des congrès de Montréal has two EV charging stations located inside its indoor carpark at 1025 Chenneville? The Palais actually joined the Electric Circuit in 2014 in order to grow the green services it offers and also pursue its commitment toward sustainability.

In addition to these two charging stations, there are 12 public charging stations on Saint-Antoine street, just steps from the Palais, and 12 other stations less than a 5-minute walk from one of our entrances. See this interactive map for all the locations!
Electric mobility is a trending topic these days, as evidenced during the recent Montreal International Auto Show. You can be sure your electric car won’t run out of power in and around the Palais.
…And should the owners of these vehicles need to recharge their batteries, they’ll find everything at the Galeries du Palais!
