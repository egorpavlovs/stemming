				Montréal to host world-class pharmaceutical sciences conference as part of the centennial celebrations of the Faculty of Pharmacy at Université de Montréal
				May 23, 2017
			
			
			Yesterday, the International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP), which is currently holding its 6th FIP Pharmaceutical Sciences World Congress in Stockholm, Sweden, announced that Montréal and the Palais des congrès have been selected to host the 7th FIP Pharmaceutical Sciences World Congress (PSWC). It will run from May 22 to 27, 2020 as part of the centennial celebrations of the Faculty of Pharmacy at Université de Montréal, and will be organized jointly with the Annual Symposium of the Canadian Society for Pharmaceutical Sciences. The events will draw 2,500 participants from all over the world and generate a total of 7,000 room nights in hotels across the city, and ultimately an estimated $5,300,000 in tourism revenue for Montréal and the province.
“Montréal is the top host city1 in the Americas for international events, and the life sciences sector is a key reason why the city enjoys such an enviable worldwide standing. By joining forces to bring these conferences to Montréal, our universities, the leaders of the life sciences sector, and the Palais des congrès make it possible for Montréal to maintain its role as a leading host of large-scale scientific gatherings,” stated Raymond Larivée, President and CEO of the Palais des congrès de Montréal. The Palais des congrès and Université de Montréal collaborated together on the bid.
The remarkable work of professors of the Faculty of Pharmacy at Université de Montréal, Denis deBlois and Michelle Savoie, who were actively involved in the development and presentation of the bid, will enable Montréal to shine internationally, and also generate significant intellectual wealth for this key segment of the life sciences sector. “This congress will examine the rapid emergence of precision medicine, with medication better adapted to individual patients and being made more accessible to communities that need them all over the world,” emphasized Denis deBlois, Chair of the PSWC 2020 congress.

				Montréal and Palais des congrès host one of world’s leading public transportation conferences
				May 12, 2017
			
			
			
From May 15 to 17, 2017, Montréal will become public-transportation-central as it welcomes the UITP Global Public Transport Summit at the Palais des congrès de Montréal. The event is expected to draw nearly 11,000 participants and visitors to Montréal, and thus generate significant tourism revenues for the city and Québec.
“The Palais des congrès de Montréal holds the highest quality standards certification in the industry, and our team has all the necessary assets to host a major convention with the level of professionalism and creativity Montréal is known for,” declared Raymond Larivée, President and CEO of the Palais des congrès de Montréal. “We’ve had teams working and collaborating together since 2010 to persuade the International Association of Public Transport to pick Montréal as their host city for their 2017 summit,” he added.
Winning the bid was made possible thanks to the concerted efforts of the Agence métropolitaine de transport (AMT), the Société de transport de Montréal (STM), the City of Montréal, Tourisme Montréal and the Palais des congrès de Montréal. To this day, the teams involved are joining forces to prepare for this convention, during which Montréal’s dynamism will be front and centre.
A smooth operation
Thanks to its 15 loading docks, oversized freight elevators, vast multipurpose rooms, and extensive experience hosting large-scale shows, the Palais des congrès de Montréal is the perfect venue for this event. The exhibition component of the Summit will require moving and showcasing transportation equipment like subway cars or other sizeable vehicles, and the Palais’ facilities can handle the complexity such an undertaking commands. Some 300 exhibitors are expected in total.
Public event
To enable the public to also share in this global scale event, the AMT and STM created “Place au transport,” an event for the Greater Montréal population that will run alongside the Summit. This event, which will take place on May 15 and 16 from 11 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., will be an opportunity to discover the past, present and future of active and public transportation in Montréal, through history, art and sensory experiences. Food trucks, live musical performances and other surprises will be in store at Place Jean-Paul-Riopelle, i.e. the city block bordered by Viger west, Saint-Antoine west, Bleury and Jean-Paul-Riopelle. Free admission. For information: placeautransport.org
A year rich in celebrations
“Festive” is the only way to describe 2017, with Montréal marking its 375thanniversary, Canada turning 150, the Montréal metro system and Expo67celebrating 50 years.

				Montréal tops 2016 North American rankings of most popular cities for international conventions, reports the ICCA
				May 11, 2017
			
			
			Montréal is back on top as the city having hosted the most international conventions in all of North America, according to the Country and City 2016 rankings released by the International Congress and Convention Association (ICCA). Montréal finished ahead of destinations like Toronto, Vancouver New York, Chicago and Washington with 76 events held at the Palais des congrès de Montréal, the universities and the city’s hotels. These events attracted nearly 37,000 business travelers and delegates to the city – 21% more than the runner-up destination. The last time Montréal finished atop the North American rankings was 2013.

“The excellent work performed by the Palais des congrès and its Ambassadors, by Tourisme Montréal and all the tourism and institutional partners, is generating remarkable results, including a top spot in international rankings like the ICCA’s,” indicated Raymond Larivée, President and CEO of the Palais des congrès de Montréal.
"It's easy to do business in Montréal. There's a synergy among the city partners, the quality of the services offered by local experts is outstanding, as is the opportunity to interact with influencers from various industry sectors, not to mention the increase in number of flights, which makes the city even more accessible. I would like to point out the excellent of everyone involved," said Yves Lalumière, President and CEO of Tourisme Montréal.
"I salute the collective effort that continues to nurture Montréal's international standing. Business tourism is of capital importance for the city's hospitality community," declared Eve Paré, President and CEO of the Hotels Association of Greater Montreal.
Satisfied attendees
Furthermore, once conventions are confirmed, Montréal and the Palais have an outstanding track record of meeting the needs and requirements of convention organizers and delegates. In fact, in a poll conducted by the Ipsos research firm for Tourisme Montréal, 95% of leisure and business tourists responded they were satisfied with their experience during their stay in Montréal in 2016. Also, 97% of business tourists would recommend Montréal to work colleagues and business contacts. “We provide an infrastructure that meets the needs of major international associations, and we are proud of our role in nurturing Montréal’s reputation as a premier destination,” said Chrystine Loriaux, Director of Marketing and Communications at the Palais des congrès.

				Expo Manger Santé et Vivre Vert: 20th edition being marked at the Palais!
				March 23, 2017
			
			
			From March 24 to 26, 2017, the Palais des congrès de Montréal will host the 20th annual Expo Manger Santé et Vivre Vert. It will mark the 16th time the show is held at the Palais since 2002, for a total of almost 195,000 visitors. The event has been growing more and more successful year after year!
Said Catherine Paul, Associate Director of Business Development and also in charge of the exhibition market at the Palais des congrès: “We are proud to play a role in the development and success of this major consumer show, which has become a must event for anyone interested in being well informed on healthy eating.” As for Renée Frappier, President of Expo Manger Santé et Vivre Vert, she added: “We enjoy working with the team at the Palais and collaborating together every year. You always feel like they’re really paying attention to your needs and that they take the event’s success to heart.”

Green all the way!
In addition to promoting healthy and natural eating, the organizers of this consumer show also focus on making it a greener event year after year. Environmental measures are applied by the Expo team at every phase of the planning process, but their biggest challenge remains managing residual waste. All the dishware used in the booths is compostable and waste is sorted and supervised by a team to ensure that the food is being recycled and composted optimally. In 2016 alone, over 2 tons of tasting containers were diverted from landfills, that’s on top of the cardboard, plastic and metal that were carefully sorted thanks to the cooperation of Expo visitors and employees.
For years, the Expo’s organizers have made communicating with exhibitors and raising their awareness a priority. By working together with the Palais’ team, measures that were deemed special or extraordinary 10 years ago have now become commonplace with this event!
The Palais, green and accessible
Located in the downtown core, the Palais des congrès is readily accessible via public transit or on foot, especially since it is directly linked to the metro network and Montréal’s underground city. The Palais is also ASTM and BOMA Best certified, making it the perfect venue for Expo Manger Santé, thanks to the tangible environmental and social practices the convention and exhibition centre rolls out in keeping with its sustainability action plan.

				Palais des congrès de Montréal: 16 aerospace events that have brought in $34.4 M in tourism revenues for Montréal and Québec
				March 8, 2017
			
			
			The Montréal aerospace industry contributes to the city’s reputation as a premier business destination through major events held at the Palais des congrès de Montréal. In the last five years, the Palais has hosted 16 regional, national and international aerospace events, which have attracted 18,500 delegates to the city. These gatherings translated into 38,500 room nights in Montréal hotels, and generated an estimated $34,000,000 in tourism income for the city and Québec. “We have every intention of continuing to encourage the holding of major international meetings related to key sectors of our city’s economy, such as aerospace,” stated Raymond Larivée, President and CEO of the Palais des congrès de Montréal. “By working closely, hand-in-hand to confirm these conventions, the Palais des congrès and the decision-makers who lead this important economic sector enable Montréal to continue to be one of the major aerospace capitals of the world,” he added.
Aerospace – Major Events Committee
To help the city maintain its status as a leading host of aerospace events, in 2011, the Palais des congrès assembled a group of experts from the industry’s key players in Montréal. The Aerospace Committee was entrusted with promoting Montréal’s immense potential worldwide, and to also provide all the necessary support required to organize international aerospace events. The taskforce’s achievements include organizing and hosting large-scale conferences like the ASME Turbo Expo, which chose Montréal and the Palais as their venue not just once, but twice. “Holding the ASME Turbo Expo at the Palais des congrès de Montréal in 2007 and more recently in 2015 was a wonderful experience. Montréal and its convention centre are a premier and natural venue for such events, and even more so for those related to the aerospace industry,” mentioned Piero Colonna, a Professor at Delft University in the Netherlands and Board Chairman of the ASME International Gas Turbine Institute.

The Palais also recently earmarked a $45,000 fund to help Aerospace Committee members and members of the local aerospace community create business ties with international convention decision-makers. “It is imperative that we consolidate our strategic backing by winning the support of influencers so we may position Montréal as ‘the’ host city for prestigious international events. The economic and intellectual benefits are huge, and we need to nurture this very active sector of our city,” said Professor Hany Moustapha, Director of the AÉROÉTS school of aerospace engineering, Emeritus Ambassador and Co-Chair of the Aerospace Committee.
The taskforce is co-chaired by Suzanne M. Benoit, CEO of Aéro Montréal (Québec’s aerospace cluster), who will be joined on March 21, by Professor Wagdi Habashi, Director of the McGill Department of Mechanical Engineering’s CFD Lab. Also represented on the taskforce: aerospace leaders Bell Helicopter, Pratt & Whitney Canada, MDA Corporation, the National Research Council Canada, Bombardier, Siemens Canada, the Consortium for Research and Innovation in Aerospace in Québec, Thales Canada, ÉTS, McGill University, Concordia University and young professionals from the industry who proudly contribute to organizing targeted events.
Montréal, aerospace city
Montréal is among the world’s Top 3 aerospace centres1 and also one of the few places in the world where virtually every aircraft component can be obtained within a 30 km radius. Greater Montréal handles 70% of the aerospace R&D conducted in Canada. The Québec aerospace industry employs over 40,000 people and generates annual sales of $15.5 billion2.
Some of the aerospace events that have chosen Montréal and the Palais des congrès:

ASME Turbo Expo 2015, 2600 delegates
Innovation Aerospace Forum and CRIAQ Research Forum 2016, 1900 delegates
Airports Council International World and North America Conference & Exhibition 2016, 2000 delegates
Aeromart Montréal 2017, 1000 delegates

Montréal, convention city
Since 2011, Montréal has been hosting more international events than any other city in the Americas, according to the rankings released by the Union of International Associations. Recipient of the highest quality standards certification in the industry and shortlisted for the World’s Best Congress Centre award (AIPC), the Palais des congrès de Montréal enjoys the collaboration of aerospace industry leaders, who in turn can count on the Palais’ experience and support, in order to foster the international reputation of an industry that is continually evolving.

				Montréal International Auto Show at the Palais des congrès: 15 years and running!
				January 19, 2017
			
			
			The Montréal International Auto Show which starts tomorrow will mark the 15th anniversary for the major consumer show at the Palais des congrès de Montréal. During the course of the 15 years, the Show and Palais team saw over 2.5 million visitors attend what constitutes the automotive event of the year for Montréalers and literally the province’s largest consumer show. More than 200,000 visitors are expected to converge on the Palais from January 20 to 29. The Show will take over nearly all of the Palais’ venues.
“It is a real pleasure for our team to contribute to the success of the Auto Show year after year, and to welcome automotive enthusiasts from all over the province, and in the process showcase the expertise of the city’s automotive professionals in an environment perfectly suited for exhibitions of this size and scope,” stated Raymond Larivée, President and CEO of the Palais des congrès de Montréal. “We are proud to have been the home of the Show and its team for the last 15 years,” added Larivée.
Logistically smooth
The Show and Palais team will be hard at work handling the more than 425 trailer and specialty trucks that will be passing through the loading dock during the setup, delivering equipment from carmakers and other exhibitors, over and above the 500 vehicles that are also expected. It is a logistical process that changes every year and has been fine-tuned since 2002! The Palais’ versatile facilities are perfect for this type of consumer show, whose sizeable booths can raise some interesting challenges installation-wise. For instance, over 600 rigging points will be required to suspend the hulking structures and decors!
The Palais, accessible and practical
Located in the downtown core, the Palais is easily accessible either by car, public transit or on foot, especially since it is directly linked to the Montréal metro system and the underground city. From the Palais car park, at the corner Chenneville and Viger, you can access the exhibition without having to set foot outside. Auto Show visitors will also have the opportunity to discover the products and services available year round at the Galeries du Palais, including the brand new Resto-bar-Code opening today!

				International awards and scientific recognition: major impacts on the reputation of research being conducted in Montréal and Québec
				November 29, 2016
			
			
			Yesterday, the Palais des congrès de Montréal, the Fonds de recherche du Québec (FRQ) and Chief Scientist Rémi Quirion convened almost 50 researchers, heads of research centres, university faculty representatives and members of the Ambassadors Club to the forum on International awards: A boost for scientific recognition. This second edition of the forum focused on the different ways researchers can promote their work within the scientific community, most notably via scientific awards and organizing major scientific conventions.
Both awards and conventions can play a role in recognizing and promoting researchers. “Attracting and holding large-scale international conventions makes it possible to generate significant intellectual benefits, while shining the spotlight on science and the scientific luminaries associated with the events. Montréal hosts more international conventions that any other city in the Americas, and the Palais is proud to actively participate in the process of putting together bids in order to help scientists looking to welcome their peers to Montréal, and the Palais,” stated Raymond Larivée, President and CEO of the Palais des congrès de Montréal, a Québec government corporation.
Nevertheless, according to Rémi Quirion, “the Québec scientific community is not on the radar in terms of scientific awards. This despite the fact we have excellent researchers in leading-edge fields like genetics, aging, economics and artificial intelligence. We should not shy away from nominating our people, we need to learn to put ourselves out there so we can enhance our international reputation even more.

				Research, intellectual benefits and conventions: A winning alliance between the IRSST and the Palais des congrès de Montréal
				November 2, 2016
			
			
			The Palais des congrès de Montréal and the Institut de recherche Robert-Sauvé en santé et en sécurité du travail (IRSST) have decided to coordinate their actions and resources in order to help promote occupational health and safety (OHS) research by attracting major national and international conventions to Montréal, and hosting them at the Palais. This new partnership is in keeping with the Palais des congrès de Montréal’s ongoing drive to build strategic alliances, and it will help boost tourism revenues and intellectual wealth for the city and Québec.
“Montréal hosts more international events1 than any other city in the Americas, and the health sciences are no stranger to this enviable position we enjoy worldwide. The Palais, the city, our Ambassadors Club and our partners work closely hand-in-hand to attract major conventions for Montréal, events that help create a wealth of knowledge scientists from here and abroad can share,” indicated Raymond Larivée, President and CEO of the Palais des congrès de Montréal. “We are proud to be associated with the IRSST, an institute that enjoys an enviable reputation in Canada and elsewhere, and whose research leadership actively contributes to promoting the city worldwide,” Larivée added.
Dr. Pavel Hamet, President of the Ambassadors Club, Marie Larue, President and CEO of the IRSST, Raymond Larivée, President and CEO of the Palais des congrès de Montréal and Hany Moustapha, Vice-President of the Ambassadors Club, at the signing of the partnership agreement.
In the 2015-2016 financial year, the Palais des congrès de Montréal hosted 24 national and international events related to healthcare and the life sciences, among the city’s most active industry sectors. These conventions, exhibitions and meetings generated over $70 million in tourism revenues, and attracted 31,000 convention-goers to Montréal, professionals who seized the opportunity to discuss knowledge advancements with colleagues from hospitals, research centres, universities and other Montréal institutions linked to health sciences.
One of the leading OHS research centres in Canada, the IRSST actively contributes to preventing work-related accidents and illnesses while also fostering worker rehabilitation. The team is made up of scientific personnel spanning researchers and professionals hailing from various disciplines such as ergonomic intervention, chemistry, sociology, engineering, demography, industrial hygiene and psychology. “This new partnership with the Palais des congrès de Montréal will make it possible for the IRSST’s scientists and the many outside researchers we collaborate with to gain more exposure locally, nationally and internationally, and to promote the IRSST’s role and influence as an OHS research centre within workplaces all across Québec. The IRSST is pleased to be associated with the Palais des congrès de Montréal and its partners in this joint effort to foster OHS research and contribute to the economic development of the city,” stated Ms. Marie Larue, President and CEO of the IRSST.
The new agreement will span various forms, including information sharing, targeting the right conventions for Montréal, and developing an IRSST-Ambassadors Club award honouring researchers who played a role in attracting international conventions for Montréal and the Palais. Since 2014, the Palais des congrès de Montréal has established partnerships with the Fonds de recherche du Québec and Montréal InVivo, in addition to setting up an Aerospace Major Events Committee.
