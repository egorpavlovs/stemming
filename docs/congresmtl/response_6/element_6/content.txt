                          The Palais des congrès de Montréal will host the International Council of Nurses (ICN) Congress, set to attract 8,000+ nursing specialists between July 1 and 5, 2023. While here, these professionals from all over the globe will generate an estimated almost $21.4M for Montréal and Québec, booking 22,400 room nights in hotels across the greater city area.
“The life sciences account for almost 40% of the conferences we host at the Palais, and this major event clearly speaks to the expertise the city’s various specialized institutions have developed over time in the field of health,” said Robert Mercure, President and CEO of the Palais des congrès de Montréal. “We are very proud and honoured to be hosting this international congress, which will give our city the opportunity to shine on the world stage, while generating significant intellectual wealth through knowledge sharing,” he added.
According to Tourisme Montréal, hosting an international congress of this scope is excellent news for Montréal! “We made it happen thanks to the synergy and teamwork of all the partners involved. The International Council of Nurses can count on our full cooperation to ensure the success of their event, and we’ll also make sure the delegates experience our city in the most unforgettable way,” declared Yves Lalumière, President and CEO of Tourisme Montréal.
The fruit of an exemplary collaboration
Indeed, securing this major event was made possible thanks to the invaluable cooperation of the teams from the Palais des congrès, Tourisme Montréal and the Canadian Nurses Association, plus the unwavering commitment of:

Nancy Feely, Co-Director of the Quebec Nursing Intervention Research Network and Associate Professor at the Ingram School of Nursing of McGill University;
Sylvie Cossette, Co-Director of the Quebec Nursing Intervention Research Network and Professor at the Faculty of Nursing of Université de Montréal;
Jacinthe Pepin, Professor at the Faculty of Nursing of Université de Montréal.

Mss. Feely, Cossette and Pepin were instrumental in bringing this prestigious international event to Montréal.
Montréal: a nursing hub in the Western world 
Montréal is an optimal choice for the ICN’s biannual congress. The city was cofounded by Jeanne Mance, the first lay nurse in North America, and this had a determining influence on the nursing community’s rich history.
The city is Canada’s leader in terms of number of research centres and amounts invested in university research. Over $10 billion have recently been invested in leading-edge infrastructures such as research centres and new hospitals (Montréal International). The OIIQ Québec order of nurses is the largest professional order in the province, with more than 75,000 members (Office des professions du Québec).
“Montreal is one of the most exciting cities in the world to visit, and importantly for our fellow nurses and nursing students globally, it is a hotbed of excellence in nursing clinical practice, science, education and leadership,” declared Claire Betker, President of the Canadian Nurses Association.
Canada has hosted this major congress three times since the ICN was created. The most recent was in 1997.
