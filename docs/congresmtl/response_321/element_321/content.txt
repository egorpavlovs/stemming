                        Planning and rolling out a congress or trade show requires months of work predicated on the most minute details. The whole Palais event management team gets involved to deliver an exceptional customer experience and a good visitor turnout for the events. Our efforts have been paying off – our customer satisfaction rate reaches 93% for the quality of our event support.
We find heart-warming the feedback from customers who appreciated the personalized way in which we shepherded them through the planning and hosting process, whether it be regarding the floorplans, catering or event technologies. We are happy to share a few of the testimonials we received.

A Few Quotes


 
    


We had a very good experience at the Palais des congrès, from the planning through the production with the help of our event manager. The team made sure we were taken care of and were very receptive and flexible to our changing needs.
Nicole Dahms - Society for Reproductive Investigation
 




 
    


All the events I have held at the Palais have been recognized as successes. The staff assisting with both the planning and execution are knowledgeable, impeccably reliable and a pleasure to work with. The in-house ancillary services such as Audio Visual and Catering have also provided the same level of high-quality and reliable services.
Michèle Bourgeois-Doyle - CNRC Conference Services Office
 




 
    


[...] from a planner’s perspective, the Palais staff was outstanding. Everyone I encountered was diligent, responsive, creative, cooperative – far and away, the BEST staff with whom I have worked.
Suzanne Dunbar - (AIHA) American Industrial Hygiene Association
