	A day dedicated to community service

    Each year, the Société du Palais des congrès de Montréal holds its Journée Coup de pouce, a day devoted to human solidarity during which Palais employees volunteer their time to helping various Montréal community organizations. The Palais has roots in the community, and it welcomes the opportunity to contribute to fighting issues like homelessness and poverty.
So on June 4, 2015, 33 employees from various departments lent a hand to organizations that devote each day to improving the lives of thousands of Montréalers.

Le sac à dos, which helps people who are homeless or on the brink of homelessness reintegrate society both socially and economically.
St. Michael’s Mission, which works directly with the poor and homeless in Montréal’s downtown core by providing clothing, food and support.
Présence Compassion, which is associated with the building council of the Notre-Dame de Montréal parish, and provides street outreach to the homeless in downtown Montréal.
Quebec Society for Disabled Children, a non-profit organization whose mission is to foster the personal development of children with special needs and their integration within the community.

What they said…
“Nice opportunity from our employer, making it possible for each participant to live unique experiences, and based on their own academic and professional background, to open other doors related to social assistance,” Lyne Joly, who volunteered at Passion Compassion
“I felt I had an impact on the day of the person I accompanied on the streets of Montréal, and that he was happy to show me how much his work mattered and was appreciated by the city. A fine way to help him regain his self-confidence and self-worth,” Julie Lalonde, who volunteered at Le Sac à dos
“The activity was an opportunity to meet a lot of homeless people and to see them in a different light, to see the individuals behind the tattered clothes who are altogether very nice and friendly, and who simply need some TLC,” Lucie Vaillancourt, who volunteered at Passion Compassion
“Being able to help an organization that works so hard to assist disabled kids is highly motivating. Seeing smiling children appreciate the little things we do makes you want to go back as soon as possible,” Annie Bédard, who volunteered at the Quebec Society for Disabled Children
“It was very enriching not only because it made it possible to be with coworkers in a different situation, but also, and most of all, because of the joy of being able to make a difference for an organization working with people in need,” Marie-Claude Roy, who volunteered at the Quebec Society for Disabled Children
“This experience changed my perception of homeless people. We forget they are incredible individuals, who are different and have a big heart. These are former doctors, lawyers, carpenters, fathers, etc. whose lives changed dramatically one day and whose heartfelt cries fell on deaf ears. These brave people inspired in me the desire to make a difference in their lives,” Maryse Lavoie, who volunteered at St. Michael’s Mission
