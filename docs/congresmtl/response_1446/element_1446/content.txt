                          The meetings and conventions world recognized the work of the Palais des congrès de Montréal at the Meeting Industry Marketing Awards (MIMA) recently presented in London. The “Numbers 1-5-52” relationship marketing and communications campaign intended for the international, U.S. and national convention markets earned the Palais the prestigious award for Best Integrated Marketing Campaign. The Palais was also shortlisted in the Best Use of Budget and Marketing Team of the Year categories.
“There’s a promotional component in our approach strategies that people notice, which this international recognition speaks to, and we are honoured. We have a magnificent convention centre and a vibrant city known for its creativity, and it is our duty to show them in the best possible light,” states Chrystine Loriaux, Palais des congrès de Montréal Director of Marketing and Communications. “This campaign, which branches out to reach several geographic markets, enabled us to convey three essential messages to potential customers looking for a venue for their next international convention,” concludes Loriaux.

1-5-52: Three numbers that speak volumes
This relationship marketing campaign was rolled out by the Palais in international, U.S. and national convention markets and was aimed at associations in the final stages of deciding which city would host their next event. With a limited campaign budget, the Palais set out to attract the attention of decision-makers with a creative message and design to secure a premium spot for Montréal and its main convention centre on the shortlist of host destinations under consideration. The campaign revolved around three numbers that are undisputedly Montréal, figures that contribute to the city’s brand within the convention market, i.e.:

1: Montréal is the #1 host city in the Americas for international events (according to the International Union of Associations);
5: Montréal has retained that top spot for five straight years (2011-2015);
52: Montréal accounts for 52% of all the international events held in major Canadian cities.

The “Numbers 1-5-52” campaign was a joint effort between the Palais’ marketing and communications, business development, and research teams, and the Samarkand Design+Communication firm.
A year filled with accolades
The Meetings + Incentive Travel trade magazine recently announced the winners of their Readers’ Choice Awards. The Palais des congrès was on the list, having earned an honourable mention in the Best Venue – Central Canada category. Palais partner Tourisme Montréal was also among the readers’ favourites, with an honourable mention in the Best Destination Marketing Organization category. These recognitions are on top of the Palais winning the AIPC Innovation Award earlier this year for its Urban Agriculture Lab – a prestigious international award given by the International Association of Convention Centres (AIPC).
