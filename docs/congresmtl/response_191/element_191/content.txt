                        A spotlight for Québec artists
The Palais des congrès is proud to display artwork from Québec artists.
You’ll find artwork inside and outside the Palais, including paintings, sculptures, land art, a glass diptych, an audacious interior landscape, and even a sculpture by Jean-Paul Riopelle in a park next to the Palais.

Landscape




Claude Cormier's highly original and colourful Jardin Nature légère / Lipstick Forest, located near Hall Place Riopelle, features 52 pink coloured trees made of concrete. This surrealist installation produced by sculptors from the Aquanov Group is intended to reproduce the trees lining Montréal’s Park Avenue. This nod to nature living in harmony with the city’s centre was awarded the first prize in the landscape architecture category by the Institute of Design Montréal, and the second prize by the Canadian Society of Landscape Architects.


 Facing the Palais is the Esplanade, a slab of concrete transformed into a magnificent garden where 31 crab apple trees planted in oval mounds intersect with cobblestone lanes so typical of Montréal. The crab apple is the city’s official tree, and in May they blossom into an explosion of pink!




 
Artwork




TRANSLUCIDE
Pilon, Cantin, Lemieux, Leblanc
2003
This installation by Jean-François Cantin, Michel Lemieux and Victor Pilon, in collaboration with NOMADE’s Martin Leblanc, is a diptych representing the Palais’ vocation as a place where people simultaneously pass through and come together, where points of view are shared and perceptions mingle. Inside the main glass façade, a pixelated hand and face evoke the connection between the human senses and human thought. This piece was chosen during an arts and architecture competition held specifically as part of the Palais’ expansion project.

AILES COULEUR DU TEMPS, NUAGE DE SOLEIL
Beauchemin, Micheline
1983
This creation by Micheline Beauchemin has been a fixture on the ceiling of the Viger lobby since 1984. Suspended from a trapeze of synthetic cables, it is composed of 7,000 polished silver aluminum rods extending in height from four to 20 feet and measuring 38 feet long.



AURORE BORÉALE
Panneton, Louise
1983
This Louise Panneton creation adorns the wall of the Viger foyer, east of Room 517. Combining 23 tapestry modules of various heights mounted on a soft wood semi-circle, this composition made of wood, aluminum, wool and silver wire creates a pulsating effect, much like the motion of the aurora borealis.

SANS TITRE (portes)
Laporte, Lucie
et Marcil, Joseph
1983
Originally on the doors to Room 517D, this piece now covers the exterior wall of Room 524A.



ÉOLIENNE V
Daudelin, Charles
1983
Piece by Charles Deaudelin created in 1983 and installed on the street corner of Saint-Antoine and Saint-Urbain.  This “mobile” features five steel masts anchored onto a granite base. A long rod sits atop each mast, and the rods spin and bend when the wind blows. This vertical, linear installation is meant to contrast with the surrounding architecture, nearby expressway and crowded space. As for the base, it affords the artwork its own well-defined area. 

HORLOGE SOLAIRE
Mongeau, André
1983
This laser installation by André Mongeau can be found at the 201 Viger west entrance. It consists of an acrylic support housing 336 optical fibres and 500 cables. A laser beam streaming through the “sundial” changes the colour of the fibres according to the sun's intensity.



LOPHOPHORE
(bird from India with colourful plumage)
Philippon, Denise
1983
Created by Denise Philippon in 1983, this piece is made of wool, linen and wood.



LA POUSSÉE VERS LE HAUT
Larivée, Francine
2003
Piece by Francine Larrivée depicting a symbolic encounter atop the roof of the Palais, where sky and water converge as one... Inspired by the need to convert a rooftop space of 4,180 sq. m. (45,000 sq. ft.) into a unique environment, this work of land art reminds us that the Palais essentially stands above what was once a river.  La Poussée vers le haut  was selected during a competition specifically sponsored by the Québec Department of Culture and Communications as part of the Palais’ expansion project.

SCULPTURE HORLOGE
Zeldakova, Olga
1983
Created by Olga Zeldakova in collaboration with Denis Matte.




MOUVEMENTS ONDULATOIRES
Grenon, Carol
1983
Collection of 6 red oak panels forming a single mural creating a circular undulating motion.


PORTES FORTERESSES
Legros, Jean-Pierre
1983
This piece was initially installed on the doors of Room 517B, and now hangs along the hallway wall of the 4th Floor, on the east side of the Palais.
