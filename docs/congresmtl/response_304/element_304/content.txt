Security services
Our security services are available 24-7.

The safety and security of our facilities and their occupants is paramount for us, from the moment we start examining your event to the time the last participant leaves the premises. Our security team is widely recognized for being proactive and efficient.

Security services:  The Palais des congrès premises and their surroundings are constantly monitored through security patrols, surveillance cameras, and an automated access control system linked to the building’s Security Operations Centre.
First aid: Our personnel is trained in first aid and certified to use cardiac defibrillators in the event of an emergency. A first-aid room and medical staff can be made available for your events.
Fire prevention:  Our qualified staff is trained in fire prevention and will immediately intervene in an emergency. First responders intervene very quickly because the Palais building also houses a Montréal fire station.
Security of rented space: You may also hire additional security staff for your rented space.
