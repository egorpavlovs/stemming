                        Ambassadors are influential and dynamic men and women who, while pursuing their professional activities, have been instrumental in bringing one or several large-scale events to the Palais, thus contributing to the economic and intellectual advancement of Montréal and the province. They are people like you, who chose to play an active role in their field.
The Palais des congrès de Montréal, a Québec crown corporation, will back and guide you every step of the way as you undertake the process of making your event a memorable experience, for both yourself and the participants. We pride ourselves on supporting our key economic sectors, and we will work alongside you on putting together your convention in Montréal.

 
Founded in 1985, the Ambassadors Club consists of 330 influential and dynamic men and women, including university professors, researchers and members of the business community, who have distinguished themselves in their field, such as Prof. Hany Moustapha, the Club’s President.
