				Did you know the Palais des congrès de Montréal has two EV charging stations located inside its indoor carpark at 1025 Chenneville? The Palais actually joined the Electric Circuit in 2014 in order to grow the green services it offers and also pursue its commitment toward sustainability.

In addition to these two charging stations, there are 12 public charging stations on Saint-Antoine street, just steps from the Palais, and 12 other stations less than a 5-minute walk from one of our entrances. See this interactive map for all the locations!
Electric mobility is a trending topic these days, as evidenced during the recent Montreal International Auto Show. You can be sure your electric car won’t run out of power in and around the Palais.
…And should the owners of these vehicles need to recharge their batteries, they’ll find everything at the Galeries du Palais!

Among the variety of general audience presentations offered by FLO, CAA-Québec, and Équiterre, there are those organized by the new Centre Déclic. In plain language that everyone can understand, the sessions will cover various facets of electric mobility, explaining concepts and fostering dialogue between scientists and the public.

The Battery Challenge  (in French only)
January 20, 2019, at 11:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m.

		A rewarding meeting with the hotel and hospitality community

				The Palais des congrès de Montréal invited the executive directors and sales and marketing managers from member hotels of the Hotel Association of Greater Montréal (AHGM), as well as management personnel from Tourisme Montréal and the Palais, to the very first Convention Industry Round Table ever organized in Montréal. Held on December 11, the purpose of the meeting was to demystify what the Palais does and how it operates, and also to give the various tourism industry partners an opportunity to share information in order to optimize cooperation.

We surveyed these high-level players from the business tourism sector after the meeting, and the response shows they are committed to working together to attract even more major events, which will benefit both Montréal and the province. The feedback also indicates they truly valued the inaugural meeting of the Round Table and the content that was shared. So much so, they will be meeting again in the spring. The Round Table will convene quarterly.
Among the many comments and ideas we received, here are some aimed at facilitating attracting more conferences:

Preparing for the positive repercussions of the Palais expansion project, should it go ahead;
Continuing to expand on the customer experience in order to remain competitive;
Continuing to spotlight Montréal’s attractions in a coordinated effort with other key industry players;
Firmly pursuing innovation, creativity and experience creation as a means of standing out;
Consistently touching base with the hotel and hospitality community and other partners, and involving them in the strategies and tactics being rolled out;
Rethinking some of the Palais’ venues to render them even friendlier, more welcoming.

Over and above these, the Palais is also working on a host of innovative projects we’ll be telling you about soon. Stay tuned, our new CEO’s vision is taking shape quickly!

				This fall, three new consumer shows joined the roster of exhibitions at the Palais des congrès de Montréal, thus contributing to the city’s rich calendar of events! Together, they attracted over 22,000 Montréalers eager to learn more about various topics.

A thriving success for the Montreal Vegan Festival 
Although in its 5th year, this was the Montreal Vegan Festival’s first time at the Palais. It was attended by thousands of vegans, vegetarians, foodies and visitors simply curious about veganism. Last October 20 and 21, the consumer show drew more visitors than expected, who were treated to 100+ exhibitors on hand to showcase their products. Congratulations to the volunteers behind this amazing success!
The Sailing Fair drops anchor at the Palais 
On November 3, various sailboat masts brushed past the ceilings of the Palais for the first time while sailing enthusiasts watched in amazement. For its 3rd edition, the event invited a number of renowned keynote speakers, and held informative and interactive workshops for the avid boaters who assembled at the Palais.
The death expo that sparked a conversation
The idea was to break taboos and facilitate discussions about subject matters related to death. It would appear the Salon de la mort succeeded on both counts on November 3 and 4. The organizers chose to host their very first show at the Palais, and the colourful and reassuring environment did not disappoint in fostering conversations with the many exhibitors, who fielded sensitive questions from thousands of visitors.

		A word from the President and CEO – Robert Mercure

It is with great pleasure that I return to Montréal after 11 years at the helm of a Québec crown jewel, the Château Frontenac. First and foremost, let me say that I absolutely love Montréal and its energy. Our city is known for its joie de vivre and I come to the Palais with a headful of new ideas.
Montréal is recognized worldwide for being dynamic, multicultural and creative. We brim with incredible talent, and I believe the Palais des congrès has a major role to play in widening the influence of our creatives and scientists. We need to be a showcase for our city. This is the vision of the Palais des congrès of tomorrow that I would like to offer Montréal.
The ingenuity and effervescence of the local community are the catalysts that will help the city assert its leadership on the international stage and the Palais be a key player among the convention centres of the future.
During the course of my first fall season at the Palais, I saw the energy that permeates our event spaces and how professionally the events themselves are handled by our teams. Just think back on NeurIPS 2018, that big AI conference everyone is still talking about, or even our prestigious Recognition Award Gala, a spectacular affair celebrating the work and dedication of 18 Ambassadors. I can assure you the Palais’ vitality is palpable.
The various initiatives our teams at the Palais will engage in will enable our convention centre to take a major leap forward. We rank 2nd in the world in terms of customer satisfaction, and we are located in the heart of the city that hosts more international events than any other city in the Americas. We can all be proud of this, and I feel confident we have everything we need to succeed.
I am thrilled to be actively participating in our city’s dynamism.
I look forward to sharing more on this with you!

				Ambassadors Club President Prof. Hany Moustapha was recently promoted to lead the Innovation 4.0 Hub and awarded the Siemens Research Chair of Industry 4.0 Technology Integration, two initiatives inaugurated by the ÉTS school of engineering last November.
These new functions will provide the Emeritus Ambassador with opportunities to position  Montréal as a global leader in Industry 4.0 technology research, and Industry 4.0 education thanks to the 50+ professors associated with the Innovation 4.0 Hub.

Timelier than ever, the Hub, aimed at better meeting Industry 4.0 requirements in five key sectors – aerospace, energy, health and safety, construction and ground transportation – will enable our businesses to remain competitive through technological advancements.  The Hub will focus on seven major research areas:

the internet of things
big data
systems integration
additive and intelligent manufacturing
augmented and virtual reality
autonomous systems
computer security

The Siemens Research Chair of Industry 4.0 Technology Integration is the first major project of the Innovation 4.0 Hub. Co-funded by the NSERC and Mitacs, it is Canada’s first industrial chair dedicated to Industry 4.0, bringing together the expertise of 20 professors from ÉTS, Concordia University and McGill University.
With Hany Moustapha heading both of these initiatives, Montréal and Québec are very likely to shine on the world stage!

				Great news to close out 2018 with a bang: the Palais des congrès de Montréal just confirmed the International Council of Nurses Congress is coming to Montréal in 2023!

Over 8,000 nursing specialists from all over the world are expected for this event, which will add an estimated almost $21.4 million to the Montréal and Québec economy, not to mention significant intellectual wealth. The Congress will generate nearly 22,400 room nights in hotels across the city.
We congratulate Nancy Feely of McGill University as well as Sylvie Cossette and Jacinthe Pépin of Université de Montréal for their efforts in securing this major event, and salute the remarkable work  of the Canadian Nurses Association, and the teams from the Palais des congrès de Montréal and Tourisme Montréal.
