                          The Palais des congrès de Montréal presented an Ambassador Achievement Award and welcomed new members to its Ambassadors Club, during its Recognition Award Gala, which salutes the exceptional contribution of influential and dynamic individuals from Montréal’s various segments of excellence who step outside of their usual professions to actively bring international conventions to the city. Held under the theme of Montréal’s 375th anniversary, the event was attended by nearly 450 of the city’s decision-makers.
New Ambassadors join the Club
With Julie Boulet, Québec Minister of Tourism and Minister responsible for the Mauricie region, in attendance, leaders were honoured during the ceremony and named Ambassadors for playing an active role in bringing major international conventions to Montréal that will generate major economic spinoffs for the city’s and province’s economy, thanks to the 18,000+ business tourists they will attract. “It is with great pride that I salute your commitment to your field of work to make this province a prized destination for business tourists from Québec, Canada, and the world over,” said Minister Boulet. “We are pleased to celebrate these new Ambassadors for their contribution to making Montréal the top host city in the Americas for international events for a fifth straight year. Because of their determination and involvement, these decision-makers will make it possible to generate significant benefits essential to advancing science and building knowledge,” added Raymond Larivée, President and CEO of the Palais des congrès.

Recipient of the Ambassador Achievement Award
In addition to being inducted as an Emeritus Ambassador for bringing a second international convention to Montréal, Denis Coderre was also presented with the Ambassador Achievement Award for the dedication and leadership he has demonstrated throughout his career, and for his commitment to Montréal. An ardent defender of the city’s interests, and recognized worldwide as a dynamic and determined individual, Denis Coderre contributes to the city’s success and to its reputation among the world’s major tourism destinations. The brainchild behind the city’s Office of International Relations and involved in numerous organizations, including the Strong Cities Network and Metropolis, he helps Montréal shine on the world stage. Throughout 2017, Mr. Coderre continues to show his deep love for Montréal by passionately contributing to the organization of celebrations surrounding the city’s 375th anniversary.
A tribute to emerging researchers
During the Gala, Professor Rémi Quirion, Québec’s Chief Scientist, honoured three étudiants-chercheurs étoiles (star student researchers), Bruno Belzile, Isabelle Bouchard and Said Izreig, all winners of the Fonds de recherche du Québec competition. The competition makes it possible to recognize the excellent research being conducted by students and to foster research careers within Québec universities. Also, Marie Larue, President and CEO of the Institut de recherche Robert-Sauvé en santé et en sécurité du travail, presented the IRSST award for best scientific article to Laeticia Bonifait.
An exceptional evening
Hosted by Ève-Marie Lortie, the evening also showcased the culinary talents of Capital Catering and the city’s major hotels: the Delta Hotel by Marriot Montréal, Fairmont Queen Elizabeth, Marriott Château Champlain, Westin Montréal, Sheraton Centre Montréal, InterContinental Montréal and Hyatt Regency Montréal. Produced by the Palais des congrès, the 2017 Recognition Award Gala was made possible with the support of Freeman Audio Visual Canada and Idées au cube.
The gift of sustainability
Together with Société de développement social and Sky Cadeaux et fleurs, the Palais des congrès is proud to have given the table centrepieces a second life by donating the flowers to the residents of the Centre d’hébergement Manoir-de-l’Âge-d’Or. An original way to spread happiness while fostering the social aspect of the Palais’ longstanding sustainability plan!
