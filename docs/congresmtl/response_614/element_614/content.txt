	The Montreal Vegan Festival Comes to Palais des Congrès

    For its fifth anniversary, the Montreal Vegan Festival is headed to Palais des Congrès de Montréal. The organizers of the exhibition, slated for October 20 and 21, 2018, have put their trust in the Palais experts for the event, which will bring together thousands of vegans, vegetarians, foodies, and anyone curious about a vegan diet.
The Montreal Vegan Festival has been a success since its very first year and has quickly become an event not to be missed. About 18,000 attendees are expected to come and mingle with some 155 exhibitors who will be showcasing the health, ethical, and environmental aspects of veganism. In addition, lectures and workshops are available to anyone interested.
You might think that a big-name sponsor must be behind such a successful event, but actually, all the credit goes to a group of about ten volunteers with a shared passion.
For Sabrina Watelle, the event’s general manager, it is important to make the exhibition as accessible as possible. That’s why admission is free to the public. In exchange, Watelle and her team are ready to work as many as 30 hours a week as volunteers, over and above their regular jobs, to make sure the Vegan Festival meets your expectations.
This public exhibition is proof that with a good idea and a strong team, anything is possible. Come and check it out! From now on, the organizers can count on our team of experts for support and advice.
