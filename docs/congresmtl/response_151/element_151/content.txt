	It’s about furnishing an experience

	 
		communications
		Hi-tech environment, Palais des congrès de Montréal
					
    
    A convention centre’s entrance halls and atria, pre-function spaces and corridors are an integral part of the event spaces, but sometimes they just look and feel… rudimentary. Not at the Palais des congrès de Montréal, where we dress and configure them to enrich the experience for participants and also optimize the flow and productivity of the event.
In February 2018, we outfitted the various common areas spanning levels 5 and 7 of the Palais with new furnishings to foster interaction, networking and comfort during breaks for both the delegates and organizers of the event.
Modern, colourful and functional, the items include communal tables equipped with power outlets, privacy armchairs, ottomans and benches to promote wellbeing, meetings or teleworking.
Take a few minutes to rest and use the solar energy to refuel before your next conference!
