    The names of the three researchers who won the International Conference Organization Support Funding Competition conducted by the Palais des congrès de Montréal Ambassadors Club and the Fonds de recherche du Québec (FRQ) were unveiled on November 20, at the recent FRQ exchange forum, jointly organized with the Palais.
The Chief Scientist of Québec, Rémi Quirion, and the President of the Palais des congrès de Montréal Ambassadors Club, Hany Moustapha, awarded the researchers for their role in the organization of an international conference in Montréal.
This year’s winning researchers are:


Denis deBlois of Université de Montréal
7th FIP Pharmaceutical Sciences World Congress
Prof. DeBlois was also appointed an Ambassador of the Palais des congrès de Montréal at the November 8 Recognition Award Gala, for helping to bring this congress to Montréal.
 

 
Pierrette Gaudreau of Université de Montréal
12e Congrès International Francophone de Gériatrie et Gérontologie
 
 
 
 


François Mathieu-Potvin of Université Laval
25th IIR International Congress of Refrigeration
*Ted Kantrowitz, appearing in the picture, accepted the award of his behalf
 
 
 
The fourth edition of the FRQ annual exchange forum, titled Diverse voices: An added value for scientific conferences, brought together nearly 70 participants, who tackled equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) and finding ways of applying these principles to the international conference organizing process.
Congratulations to the winners, and thank you to the participants.
