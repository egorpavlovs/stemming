    In addition to welcoming over 11 million leisure and business tourists every year, Montréal has been topping the list of North American host cities for international conferences since 2011. A knowledge and innovation hub, Montréal continues to be a premier gathering place for scientific fields and economic sectors such life sciences, AI and aerospace.
As the main venue for these large-scale events, the Palais des congrès de Montréal has been enjoying record-breaking numbers in terms of attendance and square footage used. Between 2012 and 2018, there has been an overall increase of 30% in the number of people participating in the various events. Nearly 105,000 convention-goers have attended the various conventions held, accounting for economic benefits estimated at nearly $133.5 M for Montréal and Québec.
