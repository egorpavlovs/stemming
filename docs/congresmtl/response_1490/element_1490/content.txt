	Homelessness, an everyday reality

    Last October 23, the Palais des congrès de Montréal, along with BOMA Québec and the Société de développement social de Ville-Marie, took part in a community homelessness prevention initiative known as La Corvée pour lutter contre l’itinérance. We asked Security Director Robert Charron to shed some light on homelessness and its impact on Palais operations.
Why take part in this initiative?
We deal with situations related to homelessness every day. This is our way of coming together with our industry colleagues to help find a solution.
Why focus on homelessness?
It’s something we live daily. As a convention centre, we host business tourists from all over the world. Our challenge is to ensure our customers fully benefit from our facilities while we also look after the safety of everyone, including those who commute through the Palais.
How do you deal with homeless people?
When someone disrupts an event in progress or normal retail operations in the shopping promenade, we intervene in a respectful and compassionate manner in order to settle the situation peacefully. This event provides us with an opportunity to learn more about homeless people and to talk to them. We are certain the experience will help us work more effectively. Also, during major conventions and shows, we sometimes involve experts specializing in preventing homelessness and facilitating reintegration.
What’s the reaction of convention-goers and event organizers?
Some are surprised there are homeless people near our venue, since so few convention centres are located in the downtown core. We’ve had situations that have sparked interesting conversations, especially with people who are less open or more sensitive to the issue of homelessness. This encourages our employees to be more mindful of individual and cultural differences.
Do you contribute to this cause in other ways?
We firmly believe every action counts, which is why we try to seize every opportunity to make a difference. Each year, we organize a day we call La journée Coup de pouce, where dozens of employees work with neighbourhood community organizations, including homeless shelters. In addition, the Palais’ caterer donates food to Maison du père, which works with homeless men. And we also sit on the homelessness taskforce set up by the Montréal police department.
