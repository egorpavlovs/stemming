The food lived up to our expectations and was exactly as it was at the tasting. The canapés were very nicely presented. The wait staff worked efficiently and very closely with our team all day. The employees were also very efficient, and above all, impeccably discreet – which is an asset very rarely found in a dining setting.”
Hélène Benoit, Activities Manager
