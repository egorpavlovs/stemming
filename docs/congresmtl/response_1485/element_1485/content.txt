                            Expo Manger Santé et Vivre Vert: 20th edition being marked at the Palais!
                        
                        
                        

													                          
                          Press releases | 2017-03-23
                          
                          From March 24 to 26, 2017, the Palais des congrès de Montréal will host the 20th annual Expo Manger Santé et Vivre Vert. It will mark the 16th time the show is held at the Palais since 2002, for a total of almost 195,000 visitors. The event has been growing more and more successful year after year!
Said Catherine Paul, Associate Director of Business Development and also in charge of the exhibition market at the Palais des congrès: “We are proud to play a role in the development and success of this major consumer show, which has become a must event for anyone interested in being well informed on healthy eating.” As for Renée Frappier, President of Expo Manger Santé et Vivre Vert, she added: “We enjoy working with the team at the Palais and collaborating together every year. You always feel like they’re really paying attention to your needs and that they take the event’s success to heart.”

Green all the way!
In addition to promoting healthy and natural eating, the organizers of this consumer show also focus on making it a greener event year after year. Environmental measures are applied by the Expo team at every phase of the planning process, but their biggest challenge remains managing residual waste. All the dishware used in the booths is compostable and waste is sorted and supervised by a team to ensure that the food is being recycled and composted optimally. In 2016 alone, over 2 tons of tasting containers were diverted from landfills, that’s on top of the cardboard, plastic and metal that were carefully sorted thanks to the cooperation of Expo visitors and employees.
For years, the Expo’s organizers have made communicating with exhibitors and raising their awareness a priority. By working together with the Palais’ team, measures that were deemed special or extraordinary 10 years ago have now become commonplace with this event!
The Palais, green and accessible
Located in the downtown core, the Palais des congrès is readily accessible via public transit or on foot, especially since it is directly linked to the metro network and Montréal’s underground city. The Palais is also ASTM and BOMA Best certified, making it the perfect venue for Expo Manger Santé, thanks to the tangible environmental and social practices the convention and exhibition centre rolls out in keeping with its sustainability action plan.
