 You can add GOLD to the Palais’ rainbow of colours now that it has received the highest level of AIPC Quality Standards certification! This major internationally-recognized certification for convention centres is awarded by the International Association of Convention Centres(AIPC) after an independent audit process.
  
  
     
  
  
    This
 certification enables the Palais des congrès de Montréal to remain 
among the world’s top convention centres, especially since there are 
only 26 certified convention centres
 worldwide. The Palais was also shortlisted as a 2014 finalist for the 
prestigious AIPC Apex award for World’s Best Congress Centre, in 
addition to earning awards for its event technologies.
       
      The
 AIPC Quality Standards program assesses a convention centre’s rigorous 
management, adherence to specific quality standards and level of 
interest in continuous improvement. It measures a convention centre’s 
quality and management performance in 10 areas: Customer Service, 
Quality of Facilities and Operations, Employee Relations, Health, 
Safety, Security and Emergency Response, Financial Integrity, Community 
Relations, Environmental Responsibility, Industry Relations and Supplier
 Relations.
      This is a recognition that also speaks volumes about Montréal, rated the top host city for international events for the last 3 years.
