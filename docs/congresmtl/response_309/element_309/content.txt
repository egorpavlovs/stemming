Unforgettable moments in a passionate city



                        Year-round festivities
Montréal offers an endless stream of festivals throughout the year and has become the world stage for such events as the International Jazz Festival, the International des feux Loto-Québec (fireworks competition), the Just for Laughs Festival, the Montréal World Film Festival, and many more. The Montréal flare for celebration is contagious and festival fever is easy to catch!
Passion for the arts
Montréal’s sophisticated dynamic of French and English influences renders the city’s culture open to the world and centre stage for a wide range of local and international artists. Whatever your cultural interests -- museums, art galleries, opera, the symphony or theatre – you will leave Montréal with lasting memories.
Shop in any weather
As Canada's fashion capital, Montréal is acclaimed for its international and local designer boutiques. And shopping here is such a pleasure, even in the rain or in winter, thanks to our many indoor malls, and a 33 km indoor underground city that links most downtown stores and hotels to the Palais.
Lots of green
A port city, situated on the banks of the majestic Saint Lawrence River, the island of Montréal offers a surprising amount of recreational green spaces, including the famous Mount Royal. In this thriving metropolis, parks, pedestrian paths, and bicycle paths continue to abound unabated. A veritable paradise for those who love the city and the outdoors!
