                                        The CHUM hospital centre entered a new phase in late April as the first of six cranes that will be needed to build the future hospital arrived. Erected at the corner of Saint-Denis and Viger, the crane will be used to build the 20-storey pavilion that will primarily house the 772 hospital rooms.
                                        The new bright and welcoming LEED certified university hospital will open in spring 2016. Both avant-garde and of international calibre, the hospital centre will be home to the very finest healthcare, research and education the world has to offer.
                                        The CHUM world-class research centre, and the integrated teaching and training centre, are also being built nearby. This new research and teaching complex will open in 2013. Featuring a unique architectural design, it will bridge the cityâ€™s Latin Quarter and Old MontrÃ©al.
