                          More than 200,000 visitors are expected to converge on the Palais des congrès de Montréal from January 16 to 25, 2015 for the 47th Montréal International Auto Show. The Palais will be hosting the province’s largest consumer show, and the automotive event of the year for Montréalers, for a 13th consecutive year.
“It is an honour for our team to contribute to the success of the Auto Show year after year, and to provide a stage for the city’s automotive community to shine,” commented Raymond Larivée, President and CEO of the Palais des congrès de Montréal. A total of 38 carmaker booths and 45 product and service booths will share nearly 350,000 sq. ft. (32,516 sqm) of prime event space in the heart of downtown.
The Show and Palais team will have handled 425 vehicles passing through the loading dock during the setup, delivering:



Type of merchandise
Number of trailer truck and specialty trucks


Items from car manufacturers
175


Items from product and service exhibitors
70


Regular vehicles
90


Specialty vehicles
90



A state-of-the-art environment geared for productivity
The Palais’ versatile and modern facilities are ideal for this type of consumer show, whose sizeable booths can raise some interesting challenges installation-wise. Over 600 rigging points were required to suspend the hulking structures and decors. The Auto Show will also enjoy the Palais’ new network infrastructure, which allows for up to 20,000 simultaneous wireless internet connections, and also features thoroughly new dynamic signage spearheaded by 90 55-inch giant screens and a video wall.
The Palais, accessible and practical
Located in the downtown core, the Palais is easily accessible either by car, public transit or on foot, especially since it is directly linked to the Montréal metro system and the underground city. Auto Show visitors will also have the opportunity to discover the products and services available year round at the Galeries du Palais, where dozens of merchants are always conveniently open for Montréal tourists, convention-goers and workers in the downtown area and Old Montréal, rain, snow or shine!
