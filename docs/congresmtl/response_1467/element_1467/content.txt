                          Quarterly Report – July 1 to September 30, 2015
For the quarter ending September 30, 2015, the Société du Palais des congrès de Montréal has confirmed it has secured seven international1 conventions, four national2 conventions and seven major trade shows to be held in the future, representing a sharp rise of 120% for the convention market over the same period last year. Confirmed in collaboration with Tourisme Montréal, the events are expected to draw over 65,000 business tourists to Montréal, also up sharply compared to last year. The participants will book over 62,000 room nights in hotels across the city. Overall, these events will result in economic benefits estimated at over $117 million, or quadruple that generated for the same quarter in 2014-2015.
“Many of the prestigious conventions confirmed recently are for over 3,000 delegates, which speaks to the excellent work being performed by the Business Development, Strategic Alliances and Marketing teams in attracting major events to the city. Their contribution, whether in the field or studying strategic data or creating impactful communications, directly influences the extent to which the city hosts major scientific conventions,” indicated Raymond Larivée, President and CEO of the Palais des congrès de Montréal. “The top host city in the Americas4 for a fourth consecutive year and Gold Quality Standards certified by the AIPC, Montréal and the Palais are both well positioned internationally, while continuing to create significant economic and intellectual wealth for all of Québec,” he added.
Among the large-scale events hosted during the quarter, 10 were conventions and six were trade shows. These accounted for an estimated nearly $51,000,000 in economic benefits. Comiccon and Otakuthon were among the shows hosted, which drew several thousand participants to Montréal during peak festival season, and the AAJ 2015 Annual Convention, which brought in an estimated sum of almost $6.2 million for the economy.
