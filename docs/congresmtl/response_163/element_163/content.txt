	Hany Moustapha at helm of Innovation 4.0 Hub

	 
		communications
		Ambassador’s Club
					
    
    Ambassadors Club President Prof. Hany Moustapha was recently promoted to lead the Innovation 4.0 Hub and awarded the Siemens Research Chair of Industry 4.0 Technology Integration, two initiatives inaugurated by the ÉTS school of engineering last November.
These new functions will provide the Emeritus Ambassador with opportunities to position  Montréal as a global leader in Industry 4.0 technology research, and Industry 4.0 education thanks to the 50+ professors associated with the Innovation 4.0 Hub.

Timelier than ever, the Hub, aimed at better meeting Industry 4.0 requirements in five key sectors – aerospace, energy, health and safety, construction and ground transportation – will enable our businesses to remain competitive through technological advancements.  The Hub will focus on seven major research areas:

the internet of things
big data
systems integration
additive and intelligent manufacturing
augmented and virtual reality
autonomous systems
computer security

The Siemens Research Chair of Industry 4.0 Technology Integration is the first major project of the Innovation 4.0 Hub. Co-funded by the NSERC and Mitacs, it is Canada’s first industrial chair dedicated to Industry 4.0, bringing together the expertise of 20 professors from ÉTS, Concordia University and McGill University.
With Hany Moustapha heading both of these initiatives, Montréal and Québec are very likely to shine on the world stage!
