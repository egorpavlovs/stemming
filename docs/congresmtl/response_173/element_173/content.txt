				The Palais des congrès de Montréal redefines its vision
				March 6, 2019
			
			
			The Palais des congrès de Montréal recently unveiled the four pillars of its new vision predicated on becoming a leading advocate for Montréal and its unique brand of creativity. This vision will be reflected in the innovative projects being rolled out in the coming weeks – initiatives that will benefit Montréalers as well as convention-goers and visitors from all over the world visiting the Palais.
“The Palais des congrès de Montréal is at the heart of a city recognized worldwide for being dynamic and creative. Our venue serves as a gateway to the city for thousands of international visitors, and we firmly intend to use this as a means of introducing them to our local knowhow – knowhow that reflects the image and reputation of our city,” explains Robert Mercure, President and CEO of the Palais des congrès de Montréal.
The Palais des congrès plans to usher in the future by providing unique experiences that will leave a lasting impression on everyone. These will be made possible thanks to the talents of Montréalers who thrive on creating memorable moments for visitors seeking unique activities and experiences during their stay here.
The new vision will further confirm the Palais’ leadership role within the industry. It will also serve to position the city and the Palais among the prime host destinations for major events.
 
The four pillars of the Palais’ new vision are as follows:
1. Living to the beat of the Montréal community
The Palais will invite Montréalers to make this iconic venue in the heart of the city their own. The various initiatives that will be announced will inspire citizens to dream and take proud ownership of their Palais as a gathering place. They will get a taste of this new side of the Palais in late March.
2. Showcasing local scientists and creatives
The city brims with sectors that nurture its international reputation. The Palais has chosen to play a major role in broadening the reach of these sectors and will spotlight the incredible talent found in Montréal.
3. Giving visitors a fascinating experience
The ability to generate excitement and deliver unforgettable experiences is among the leading criteria major associations look for in potential host cities. Montréal is a destination that leaves a lasting impression, and the Palais will contribute to making the events it welcomes memorable.
4. Helping define the convention centre of tomorrow
Galvanizing the world with best practices and setting the standards of tomorrow – it is a challenge the Palais has agreed to take on, so that Montréal may continue to be the busiest host city in the Americas for international events (UIA 2017).
 
This bold vision will take shape gradually, with the help of the industry’s key players and local expertise: “All the partners agree that this vision reflects the direction the Palais must take to remain competitive and stand out on the international stage. The success of our transformation rests on the alliances we will form with local partners united in championing the city, its creatives and the various fields they represent,” concludes Robert Mercure.
			
		
		
				
		
			
			
				More than 8,000 nurses from all over the world expected at the Palais des congrès de Montréal in 2023
				February 12, 2019
			
			
			The Palais des congrès de Montréal will host the International Council of Nurses (ICN) Congress, set to attract 8,000+ nursing specialists between July 1 and 5, 2023. While here, these professionals from all over the globe will generate an estimated almost $21.4M for Montréal and Québec, booking 22,400 room nights in hotels across the greater city area.
“The life sciences account for almost 40% of the conferences we host at the Palais, and this major event clearly speaks to the expertise the city’s various specialized institutions have developed over time in the field of health,” said Robert Mercure, President and CEO of the Palais des congrès de Montréal. “We are very proud and honoured to be hosting this international congress, which will give our city the opportunity to shine on the world stage, while generating significant intellectual wealth through knowledge sharing,” he added.
According to Tourisme Montréal, hosting an international congress of this scope is excellent news for Montréal! “We made it happen thanks to the synergy and teamwork of all the partners involved. The International Council of Nurses can count on our full cooperation to ensure the success of their event, and we’ll also make sure the delegates experience our city in the most unforgettable way,” declared Yves Lalumière, President and CEO of Tourisme Montréal.
The fruit of an exemplary collaboration
Indeed, securing this major event was made possible thanks to the invaluable cooperation of the teams from the Palais des congrès, Tourisme Montréal and the Canadian Nurses Association, plus the unwavering commitment of:

Nancy Feely, Co-Director of the Quebec Nursing Intervention Research Network and Associate Professor at the Ingram School of Nursing of McGill University;
Sylvie Cossette, Co-Director of the Quebec Nursing Intervention Research Network and Professor at the Faculty of Nursing of Université de Montréal;
Jacinthe Pepin, Professor at the Faculty of Nursing of Université de Montréal.

Mss. Feely, Cossette and Pepin were instrumental in bringing this prestigious international event to Montréal.
Montréal: a nursing hub in the Western world 
Montréal is an optimal choice for the ICN’s biannual congress. The city was cofounded by Jeanne Mance, the first lay nurse in North America, and this had a determining influence on the nursing community’s rich history.
The city is Canada’s leader in terms of number of research centres and amounts invested in university research. Over $10 billion have recently been invested in leading-edge infrastructures such as research centres and new hospitals (Montréal International). The OIIQ Québec order of nurses is the largest professional order in the province, with more than 75,000 members (Office des professions du Québec).
“Montreal is one of the most exciting cities in the world to visit, and importantly for our fellow nurses and nursing students globally, it is a hotbed of excellence in nursing clinical practice, science, education and leadership,” declared Claire Betker, President of the Canadian Nurses Association.
Canada has hosted this major congress three times since the ICN was created. The most recent was in 1997.

				The biggest consumer show in Québec comes to Palais des congrès de Montréal
				January 17, 2019
			
			
			The Montréal International Auto Show, the biggest consumer show in Québec, will be held January 18–27 at Palais des congrès de Montréal. Some 200,000 attendees are expected at this year’s event, whose main theme is electric mobility.

“We’re proud to be hosting Québec’s most popular auto event. Our facilities are a perfect fit for large-scale consumer shows like this,” said Robert Mercure, CEO of Palais des congrès de Montréal. “It’s an honour for us to showcase the know-how of local auto specialists and give car enthusiasts a chance to check out the eco-friendly options on the market,” he added.
An event like the Auto Show takes up almost all the space available at the Palais and presents considerable logistical challenges. During set-up, Auto Show and Palais staff have to coordinate the arrival of more than 425 truckloads of automobile manufacturers’ and exhibitors’ equipment at the 15 loading bays, not to mention the 500 cars and other vehicles visitors can’t wait to admire. It’s an operation that has been fine-tuned and improved every year since 2002. The Palais’s versatile facilities are perfect for the show as they can easily accommodate oversize booths. More than 700 rigging hooks will be needed to hang the imposing structures and decor!
Setup operations for the Auto Show start January 7, with tear-down to be completed by January 30.
An electrifying event!
Car buffs, take note: The 76th Auto Show will feature a record 42 electric vehicles on display throughout the venue.
New this year is The Generator, a zone dedicated to electric mobility. Here visitors will be able to learn more about electric products and services.
At the Hydro-Québec stage within The Generator, visitors will be able to attend a variety of general audience presentations on different facets of electric mobility. Auto Show ticket holders can also attend science talks for the general public offered free of charge by Centre Délic, FLO, CAA-Québec, and Équiterre.
Focus on innovation
The 2019 Auto Show features several new attractions, such as the mysterious Black Box. In this special room, visitors will be able to view two of the three fastest cars in the world and an exotic car designed entirely in Québec. The Garage, an updated version of The Performance Zone, is sure to be popular among modified car fans.
The full schedule is available on the Montréal International Auto Show website:
https://www.salonautomontreal.com/en/
The Palais, convenient and accessible
Located in the heart of downtown, Palais des congrès is easy to get to by car and public transit or on foot. There is direct access to the metro and Montréal’s underground walkways. From the parking lot at the corner or Chenneville and Viger, visitors can access the show without having to go outside. Public charging stations for electric cars are available nearby. The shops and amenities at Galeries du Palais mall will also be open throughout the show.
			
		
		
				
		
			
			
				Palais des congrès de Montréal introduces  first Round Table on Convention Industry
				December 18, 2018
			
			
			The Palais des congrès de Montréal put together the very first Convention Industry Round Table ever held in Montréal. The December 11 event was attended by executive directors and sales and marketing managers from member hotels of the Hotel Association of Greater Montréal (AHGM), as well as management personnel from Tourisme Montréal and the Palais des congrès de Montréal.
These representatives on the frontlines of the business tourism economy shared data and devised new avenues of cooperation aimed at enabling Montréal to continue growing by hosting major conventions.
“Given the increased competition in the convention market, it has become essential to work closely with all industry partners to attract more and more major events. These conventions generate significant economic and intellectual benefits for the city, and Québec, and help expand the reach of the key sectors of our economy and our universities,” explained Robert Mercure, President and CEO of the Palais des congrès de Montréal. “The quality of Montréal’s hotel and hospitality offering, the excellent reputation of the tourism office, combined with the quality of the Palais’ offering and customer service, constitute incredible assets for Montréal, and we firmly intend to continue moving forward with our development efforts,” he added.
After learning extensively about the Palais’ business model and the statistics related to attracting international, American and Canadian conventions, the participants were able to express their ideas and thoughts on promoting Montréal and further upping its appeal in the convention market.
“We are glad the industry reached out to the Montréal hotel and hospitality community for its expertise and that  our input had a role to play in the drafting of the strategies designed to make Montréal a business destination,” said a delighted Eve Paré, CEO of the Hotel Association of Greater Montréal. “Working together is paramount if we want to ensure the city remains competitive internationally,” she continued.
“Tourisme Montréal is proud to have collaborated on this first round table and is committed to its success. The meeting showed that transparency and cooperation are excellent qualities tourism partners can rally around. We all have a part to play in elevating Montréal and its convention centre to the top of the list for hosting major conventions and events,” stated Mylène Gagnon, Vice-President of Sales and Convention Services at Tourisme Montréal.
Introducing the new Montréal Business Destination Taskforce
In the spirit of fostering coordinated joint efforts and ensuring the rollout of tangible actions to stimulate business tourism in the city, a new taskforce -- Montréal Business Destination -- was also created. Made up of representatives from the city’s largest hotels and industry players such as the Palais des congrès de Montréal and Tourisme Montréal, this taskforce will meet quarterly and serve as a united front promoting Montréal as “the” host city for major events.
A meeting that reflects the new vision of the Palais
Based on a winning formula that facilitates the sharing of information, the Convention Industry Round Table promises to become an industry staple. This desire to work closely with the Montréal community mirrors Robert Mercure’s new vision for the Palais of tomorrow, which the participants were briefed on during the event. Determined to help drive the Montréal brand of creativity, the Palais des congrès is focused on being a showcase for local scientists and creatives, while also empowering Montréalers to reclaim their convention centre. The new President and CEO and his team are eagerly working on developing new avenues that will help position the Palais at the very heart of efforts to create the convention centre of the future.

“Partnering with the FRQ enables Montréal to take advantage of major economic and intellectual benefits. By combining our efforts and recognizing the work of people who actively contribute to the organization of international scientific conferences in our city, we are ensuring Montréal will continue to be at the top of the list of cities in the Americas that host the most international conferences,” stated Robert Mercure, President and CEO of the Palais des congrès de Montréal.
A forum on equity, diversity and inclusion
The ceremony took place during the annual exchange forum the Fonds de recherche du Québec (FRQ) jointly organizes with the Palais des congrès de Montréal. Titled  Diverse voices: An added value for scientific conferences, the fourth edition of the forum brought together nearly 70 participants, who tackled equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) and finding ways of applying these principles to the international conference organizing process.
“Bringing the principles of EDI across the entire research ecosystem, including how we disseminate findings, is something we’re focusing on at the FRQ. Scientific conferences are important activities for researchers, because they foster networking, the sharing of ideas, science careers and the spread of knowledge and skills. They also provide an opportunity to present and discuss best research practices,” added Rémi Quirion, the Chief Scientist of Québec.

				November 9, 2018
			
			
			During their Recognition Award Gala of November 8, the Palais des congrès de Montréal marked the invaluable collaboration of 18 Ambassadors who helped bring 12 international conferences to Montréal. These major events represent over $73 million in economic benefits for Montréal and Québec, and will draw more than 32,000 delegates to the city. “Montréal hosts more international events than any other city in the Americas, an honour vastly attributable to our Ambassadors and their commitment to advocating for their city and their scientific fields all over the world,” mentioned Robert Mercure, President and CEO of the Palais des congrès de Montréal. “The Recognition Award Gala recognizes the undeniable contribution and leadership of these Ambassadors, but also the role played by our industry partners, especially Tourisme Montréal and the Hotel Association of Greater Montréal,” he added.
“For over 30 years, the Club’s Ambassadors have helped to make Montréal the city that hosts the greatest number of international events in North America. They include dedicated individuals who, through their efforts to attract thousands of convention delegates to Montréal, are enabling Québec to take advantage of a striking showcase among international clienteles”, noted Minister of Tourism Caroline Proulx.

				Palais des congrès de Montréal : Among the world’s best convention centres
				July 18, 2018
			
			
			The Palais des congrès de Montréal emerged as the runner-up for the APEX Award in Recognition of the Highest Client Rating Received by a Convention Centre. The Palais earned the prestigious international accolade, presented on July 3 in London, on the strength of an exceptional score.
The AIPC APEX Award honours the world’s convention centre with the best customer satisfaction rating for quality. This comes on the heels of the AIPC having recently Gold Quality Standard certified the Palais des congrès, meaning the Montréal venue now joins a very small group of convention centres having both received that certification and also been shortlisted for the APEX Award in recognition of their customer service excellence. “We are very proud of this distinction, which reflects how passionate our teams are about satisfying our clients,” declared Raymond Larivée, President and CEO of the Palais des congrès de Montréal. “When you combine our employees’ knowhow with the excellent quality of our offering, this allows us to deliver the very best to our customers, as we continually strive to exceed their expectations,” he added.
AIPC Apex Award
The AIPC Apex Award is a bi-annual recognition of excellence in convention centre customer service quality. The winner and the two runners-up are determined on the basis of a comprehensive analysis of centre performance in a wide range of areas based on customer satisfaction surveys. A separate independent evaluation process carried out by Ipsos ensures a review of factors such as project management quality, as well as catering and technical capacity.
			
		
		
				
		
			
			
				Montréal hosts more international conferences than any other city in the Americas
				July 10, 2018
			
			
			Montréal ranks first among the top cities in the Americas where international conferences are planned. This is according to the prestigious report issued by the Union of International Associations (UIA) for 2017. Montréal hosted 149 international conferences, finishing ahead of cities like Washington, New York, Chicago, Buenos Aires and Toronto. That's a new record, eclipsing the previous mark of 108 events set in 2005. More impressive still, Montréal hosted almost two-and-a-half times the events held by the second-place city.

Overall, Montréal accounted for 61% of all international events held in Canada. This figure clearly reflects the city's reputation within this key market, which contributes significantly to the Montréal and Québec economy. The city ranks 15th worldwide.
"The excellent work by the Palais' teams and Ambassadors, our partners, especially the Fonds de recherche du Québec, the IRSST, Montréal InVivo, the universities, the hotel industry and the City of Montréal, is bearing fruit and yielding remarkable results. This development strategy combined with Tourisme Montréal's efforts in promoting our city are ensuring Montréal retains its select status among the world's top host cities in the world for international conferences," emphasized Raymond Larivée, President and CEO of the Palais des congrès de Montréal. "The opportunity to play a role in the major events that are shaping tomorrow's Québec and spreading its reputation globally is a privilege that galvanizes everyone on the Palais team," he added.
"Business tourism is a big lucrative market for Montréal. It generates significant economic and tourism benefits. 2017 was a record year for conferences, business meetings and sporting events. We attract thousands of participants each year, who continue to be increasingly satisfied with their experience. These rankings reiterate our leadership atop the America's tourism industry. They are proof that we need to continue to work together to deliver an experience that is uniquely Montréal," said Yves Lalumière, President and CEO of Tourisme Montréal.
Founded in 1907 by Nobel Prize winner Henri La Fontaine and Paul Otlet, the UIA publishes these world rankings based on a database consisting of 68,000+ organizations in 300 countries and territories.
At the top of another prominent international ranking
The International Congress and Convention Association (ICCA) also ranks Montréal among the world's top host cities for international events. Number One in North America and second in the Americas, after Buenos Aires, the city performed well on the ICCA's list, whose results stem from a database of over 12,000 events that rotate between at least three different countries.
A new record: the 96 Montréal events the ICCA compiled for its 2017 list amount to a 26% increase over the previous record set in 2016. Since 2002, Montréal has topped the North America standings 10 times.

				World Robot Olympiad coming to the  Palais des congrès de Montréal in 2020
				June 27, 2018
			
			
			From November 13 to 15, 2020, the Palais des congrès de Montréal will serve as the venue for the International Final of the World Robot Olympiad (WRO). The event, organized by Zone01, will draw 2,000 participants to Montréal and generate $1,818,000 in tourism revenue for the city and Québec. This international competition attracts students between the ages of 7 and 25 from over 60 countries. Each year, more than 20,000 teams from all over the world build robots and take on various WRO challenges in order to qualify for the International Final and represent their country.
“We feel privileged to host these promising young creative minds and to play an active role in an event that is so clearly aligned with the importance we attribute to robotics and AI in Montréal. The intellectual wealth that will result from the event will greatly benefit students, researchers, universities and anyone advocating  for technology,” stated Raymond Larivée, President and CEO of the Palais des congrès de Montréal.
The crucial involvement of dynamic local influencers
This international bid coordinated by Andrée-Anne Sauvageau of the Palais de congrès de Montréal and funded by Tourisme Montréal, was presented at the most recent Olympiad, held in Costa Rica. The participation of Dominic Bruneau, a graduate of École Polytechnique and HEC Montréal, had a determining impact on the Palais and Montréal being awarded the event. Mr. Bruneau spent several years designing vision systems for industrial automation, and has been a member of numerous robotics clubs. He helped establish Zone01 as the WRO National Organizer for Canada. “I get involved in local and international competitions to offer young people the opportunity to broaden their horizons by exploring robotics systems. They represent our future scientists, engineers, manufacturers and inventors, and I like to see the spark in their eyes when they create and program robots,” said Bruneau.
City known as a bustling centre for AI and robotics

			Montréal, June 20, 2018 — The Palais des congrès and Tourisme Montréal teams are delighted to have won the bid to host the 2023 ISTH Annual Congress, a major event organized by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis. Thanks to the efforts of the two partners, combined with the support of key resources from the life sciences community, nearly 8,000 delegates will meet in Montréal, book 22,400 room nights in the city’s hotels and bring in tourism revenues in excess of $21,500,000.
The bid was widely supported by the scientific community. Dr. Susan Kahn and Dr. Marc Rodger, co-directors of CanVECTOR, the Canadian Venous Thromboembolism Clinical Trials and Outcomes Research Network, put together a conference program focused on the development of young and emerging researchers, which wowed the leadership of the international association, which currently has 4,000+ members from 94 countries. “The determination, commitment and energy with which Tourisme Montréal embraced the idea of making our international congress a bona fide success were determining factors in our decision, as were the quality of the venue and the support we can expect from the team of professionals at the Palais des congrès de Montréal,” mentioned Lisa Astorga, the ISTH Director
of Meetings.
“The researchers’ involvement is invaluable to the process of bringing an international conference to Montréal. For those tasked with selecting the host city and site for their next conference, these scientists are the manifestation of the desire, vitality and support of the city’s various economic sectors to hold these events that have a tremendous impact on our city. By working closely together to attract major conventions, the universities, the leaders of this key economic cluster, and the Palais des congrès make it possible to generate economic and intellectual benefits for Montréal and Québec,” said Raymond Larivée, President and CEO of the Palais des congrès de Montréal.
“The synergy and teamwork displayed by the partners were rewarded with success! Well done! Hosting this international event is excellent for the city’s brand as a global convention destination and its reputation as a life sciences hub. The ISTH team and researchers can count on our cooperation to ensure their congress is a success,” stated Yves Lalumière, President and CEO of Tourisme Montréal.
