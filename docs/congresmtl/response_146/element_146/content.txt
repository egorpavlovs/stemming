	Palais attracts major nursing conference

	 
		communications
		Conventions
					
    
    Great news to close out 2018 with a bang: the Palais des congrès de Montréal just confirmed the International Council of Nurses Congress is coming to Montréal in 2023!

Over 8,000 nursing specialists from all over the world are expected for this event, which will add an estimated almost $21.4 million to the Montréal and Québec economy, not to mention significant intellectual wealth. The Congress will generate nearly 22,400 room nights in hotels across the city.
We congratulate Nancy Feely of McGill University as well as Sylvie Cossette and Jacinthe Pépin of Université de Montréal for their efforts in securing this major event, and salute the remarkable work  of the Canadian Nurses Association, and the teams from the Palais des congrès de Montréal and Tourisme Montréal.

    The Palais des congrès de Montréal has assembled a group of leaders representing eight of the city’s key economic sectors to form a new Multisector Strategic Taskforce. Their mission will be to establish ties with influencers who will actively contribute to attracting major international conferences to Montréal and the Palais des congrès.
Among the members sitting on this prestigious taskforce are:







Louise M. Benoît, president of Aéro Montréal
Frank Béraud, Chief Executive Officer of Montréal InVivo






Mathieu Charbonneau, Executive Director of CargoM
James J. Clark, Professor at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of McGill University






Fabrice Labeau, Interim Deputy Provost, Student Life and Learning, at McGill University
Marie Larue, Chief Executive Officer of the Institut de recherche Robert-Sauvé en santé et en sécurité du travail






Maryse Lassonde, Scientific Director of the Fonds de recherche du Québec – Nature et technologies
Serge Marchand, Scientific Director of the Fonds de recherche du Québec – Santé






Louise Poissant, Scientific Director of the Fonds de recherche du Québec – Société et culture
Gilles Savard, Chief Executive Officer of IVADO



 
The role of the vastly experienced leaders who make up the new Multisector Strategic Taskforce will be to develop and nurture ties with researchers, scientists and business executives who might be inclined to actively participate in the process of bringing large-scale international gatherings to Montréal. They will be able to mine their networks for topnotch collaborators and match them with specific conferences.
Conferences advance science
Montréal is widely recognized as a knowledge hub. The city attracts international conferences that enable local researchers and experts to interact with peers who have travelled here from every continent. The Palais des congrès de Montréal works very closely with its Ambassadors and partners to advocate for the major sectors driving the Montréal and Québec economy.

	Experient Supplier of the Year Nominee

		Conventions, Palais des congrès de Montréal
					
    
    The Palais’ event managers work as suppliers to numerous professional convention organizers (PCO) throughout the year to set up their events at the Palais. They develop working relationships and form one-off teams to contribute to the success of the event.
To recognize the outstanding job done by their suppliers who continually goes above and beyond, Experient, a global meeting and events management company, has developed the Supplier of the Year award process. The Experient Supplier of the Year Awards are based on several criteria:

Making an extraordinary contribution to Experient and their clients’ success
Displaying outstanding character and integrity
Displaying ongoing excellence in their job—responsiveness, problem‑solving skills, etc.
Sharing in our vision of continuing to perfect the event experience by demonstrating continued excellence in their job

In 2017, our very own Karine Plamondon was nominated for the title. Here is what an Experient team member had to say about Karine’s work:
“I have had the pleasure of working with Karine three different times over the last 10 years. Each experience has been exceptional, she is more than willing to go above and beyond for you and your group. She completely understands who Experient is and respects the relationship we have with our clients. Every convention center has their own unique rules and regulations and the Palais des congrès is no different. What makes them different is having a convention service manager like Karine to personally walk you through these regulations and help find ways to make them work for your individual groups. She makes sure all departments are giving high levels of customer service, helps negotiate internal costs in order to stay within the client’s budget, and is a great resource when contracting external suppliers. It is very rare to work with the same individual each time you return to a location (especially over a period of 10 years) but that is what I have had the pleasure of doing. I love knowing that when I return to Montreal, I’ll be working once again with a great partner and dear friend!” – Kim Rhodes, Senior Meeting and Event Manager
Congratulations Karine and keep up the good work!

	Seizing on Montréal’s expertise to predict the social impacts of Artificial Intelligence

    On March 27, 2018, the Fonds de recherche du Québec, in partnership with Université de Montréal, held a workshop at the Palais des congrès de Montréal on a project to create a world observatory on the social impacts of artificial intelligence (AI) and digital technologies. Nearly one hundred people from all of Québec’s universities were in attendance, along with representatives from government departments, civil society organizations and the AI sector.
According to the workshop organizers, all activity sectors are going to be increasingly affected by artificial intelligence. While it holds extraordinary potential to foster economic development and improve living conditions, AI also raises concerns with regard to jobs, security, democracy, ethics and the professional, social and private spheres of our lives; hence the idea to create an observatory on these social issues.
Held in November 2017, the workshop was as a follow-up to the Forum on the Socially Responsible Development of Artificial Intelligence and jointly organized with the Palais des congrès. By bringing together experts from fields ranging from pure science to the humanities and social sciences, the Forum sparked a collective discussion on the ethical and socially responsible development of AI.

The Palais des congrès de Montréal recently confirmed it will be hosting yet another major AI convention, more evidence of just how dynamically this scientific field is developing in the city. The 30th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI) will be coming in 2021 and attract nearly 3,000 experts from all over the world.
