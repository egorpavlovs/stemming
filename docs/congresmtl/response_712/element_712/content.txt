	MtlWiFi: So convenient, and it’s free

    Since June 2015, Palais des congrès de Montréal delegates and visitors have not only been enjoying the free wi-fi available on Level 1 of the Palais, but also MtlWiFi, a free wi-fi service recently deployed around the Palais area and in Old Montréal. It’s a great way to discover the city’s attractions while staying connected!
A winning partnership
MtlWiFi is being made possible thanks to a partnership between the Palais des congrès, the City of Montréal and Montréal en Histoires. Each partner was originally planning to offer free wi-fi to their respective clientele, so all three organizations decided instead to jointly focus their efforts toward deploying a free wi-fi network that would launch as early as June 2015. Coverage is gradual, starting with the streets neighbouring the Palais des congrès and Old Montréal, and will eventually expand to include other areas, such as the Quartier des spectacles or the Quartier latin. The Palais des congrès also received funding from the government of Québec and partnered with the firm Openface Internet to kick start the service, which will help perpetuate Montréal’s brand and reputation as a premier business destination.
A smart and digital city for high-tech conventions
MtlWiFi is among the 70 projects included in the Montréal Smart and Digital City Action Plan, which aims to position the city as a global leader among the world’s smart cities. The initiative nicely complements the Palais des congrès’ own major IT modernization project, which offers organizers a wealth of event technologies focused on propelling their events to new heights, including new and innovative advertising opportunities for their sponsors.
