                          This evening, the Palais des congrès de Montréal marked the 30th Anniversary of its Ambassadors Club by inducting 14 new members who were actively involved in securing 10 international conventions for Montréal. These major events will generate nearly $128 M in economic benefits for the city and the province, and attract 40,000 business tourists to Montréal. “Montréal has been hosting more international conventions than any other city in the Americas for the last three years, and that is namely due to the efforts of our Ambassadors in promoting our city to major international associations,” declared Raymond Larivée, President and CEO of the Palais des congrès. “The tourism, business and academic communities work passionately to ensure Montréal maintains this prestigious standing,” added Larivée.
“Tourism spurs wealth. The proof is in the excellent economic forecast for business tourism in Montréal for the coming years. I am therefore proud to be associated with the Palais des congrès de Montréal Recognition Award Gala and the light it shines on the exemplary work of its Ambassadors. I congratulate them warmly for their remarkable contribution to the economic development of our city, but also for what this influx of tourists means for Québec as a whole. Between now and 2020, the tourism industry has set an annual objective of 5% growth in tourism expenditures. Business tourism will certainly play a key role in meeting that target,” remarked Québec’s Minister of Tourism, Dominique Vien.
Fourteen new Ambassadors join the Club
The Recognition Award Gala salutes the exceptional contribution of influential and dynamic individuals from Montréal’s various segments of excellence who step outside of their usual professions to actively bring international conventions to the city, and thus help generate economic and intellectual benefits for the city and province. “The Ambassadors Club has been growing year after year since 1985, and it now has nearly 300 members united in their efforts to make Montréal a hub for higher learning and knowledge-sharing,” added Dr. Pavel Hamet, President and Ambassador of the Ambassadors Club.

The competition makes it possible to recognize the excellent research being conducted by students and to foster research careers with Québec universities.
An exceptional gala
Hosted by Marius Brisson, the evening also featured Capital Catering and the city’s major hotels: the Sheraton Centre Montréal, the InterContinental Montréal, the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth, the Hyatt Regency Montréal, the Marriott Château Champlain, the Westin Montréal and the Hilton Montréal Bonaventure. Produced by the Palais des congrès, the 2015 Recognition Award Gala was made possible with the support of the Québec Department of Tourism, Freeman Audio Visual and Idées au cube.
Indispensable partners
“We are proud to be partnering in this remarkable event aimed at recognizing the Palais des congrès de Montréal’s Ambassadors and their important contribution, as well as all the key players involved in advocating for Montréal as a first-rate destination,” indicated Bernard Carignan, Regional Director, Eastern Canada for Freeman Audio Visual. For her part, Nathalie Gélinas, Vice-President of Idées au cube, added: “As the associate producer of the Recognition Award Gala for the last many years, our firm is pleased to contribute to the promotion of local creativity and excellence. We congratulate the Palais Ambassadors and star researchers honoured tonight.”
