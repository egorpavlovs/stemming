                          Between now and yearend 2015, the Palais des congrès de Montréal will host 10 major national1 and 18 international2 conventions that will generate nearly $121,000,000 in estimated economic benefits for Montréal and the province. These events will attract over 80,000 business tourists and exhibitors, and translate into almost 106,000 room nights being booked in hotels across the city.
“Business tourism related activities have a significant impact on the city’s and province’s economy, not to mention the developments and the information being exchanged at these events that help move sectors like healthcare, aerospace and IT forward,” says Raymond Larivée, President and CEO of the Palais des congrès de Montréal. “The flexibility, efficiency and quality of our facilities and event technologies make our venue ideal for large-scale conventions,” adds Larivée, as evidenced by the AIPC Gold Quality Standards certification the Palais earned in March. It is the highest recognition of quality awarded by the international convention centre industry, thus further entrenching the Palais’ role as a leader on the global business tourism scene.
The following conventions, confirmed in collaboration with Tourisme Montréal, will bring together professionals and experts from all over the planet, who will seize their time in Montréal to discover the city, its attractions, restaurants, festivals, etc. – a city, which incidentally, has been rated the top host city in the Americas by the Union of International Associations three years running.
