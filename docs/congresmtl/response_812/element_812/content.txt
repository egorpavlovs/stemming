                                        Montr√©alers love to take their ‚Äújoie de vivre‚Äù outdoors, gathering on the city‚Äôs terraces to enjoy the long-awaited nice weather! Known for its festive atmosphere, the city brims with venues where people can enjoy a drink or a meal with friends or co-workers. There are a few last beautiful fall evenings to enjoy!
                                         Whether you prefer peace and quiet in a garden setting, or something more lively and modern, every taste can be satisfied! You‚Äôll even find terraces with superb aerial views of Montr√©al, such as AIX La Terrasse, Suite 701, and the rooftop terrace of the Nelligan hotel, all of which are located in Old Montr√©al, not far from the Palais.
                                      Nevertheless, no matter what part of the city you‚Äôre in, downtown or in a residential area, terraces abound‚Ä¶ From the Mile End district and the classic Caf√© Olimpico, to Little Italy and the charming Vices & Versa, enjoying Montr√©al is as easy as pulling up a chair!
