    The Palais des congrès de Montréal has assembled a group of leaders representing eight of the city’s key economic sectors to form a new Multisector Strategic Taskforce. Their mission will be to establish ties with influencers who will actively contribute to attracting major international conferences to Montréal and the Palais des congrès.
Among the members sitting on this prestigious taskforce are:







Louise M. Benoît, president of Aéro Montréal
Frank Béraud, Chief Executive Officer of Montréal InVivo






Mathieu Charbonneau, Executive Director of CargoM
James J. Clark, Professor at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of McGill University






Fabrice Labeau, Interim Deputy Provost, Student Life and Learning, at McGill University
Marie Larue, Chief Executive Officer of the Institut de recherche Robert-Sauvé en santé et en sécurité du travail






Maryse Lassonde, Scientific Director of the Fonds de recherche du Québec – Nature et technologies
Serge Marchand, Scientific Director of the Fonds de recherche du Québec – Santé






Louise Poissant, Scientific Director of the Fonds de recherche du Québec – Société et culture
Gilles Savard, Chief Executive Officer of IVADO



 
The role of the vastly experienced leaders who make up the new Multisector Strategic Taskforce will be to develop and nurture ties with researchers, scientists and business executives who might be inclined to actively participate in the process of bringing large-scale international gatherings to Montréal. They will be able to mine their networks for topnotch collaborators and match them with specific conferences.
Conferences advance science
Montréal is widely recognized as a knowledge hub. The city attracts international conferences that enable local researchers and experts to interact with peers who have travelled here from every continent. The Palais des congrès de Montréal works very closely with its Ambassadors and partners to advocate for the major sectors driving the Montréal and Québec economy.

	Experient Supplier of the Year Nominee

	 
		communications
		Conventions, Palais des congrès de Montréal
					
    
    The Palais’ event managers work as suppliers to numerous professional convention organizers (PCO) throughout the year to set up their events at the Palais. They develop working relationships and form one-off teams to contribute to the success of the event.
To recognize the outstanding job done by their suppliers who continually goes above and beyond, Experient, a global meeting and events management company, has developed the Supplier of the Year award process. The Experient Supplier of the Year Awards are based on several criteria:

Making an extraordinary contribution to Experient and their clients’ success
Displaying outstanding character and integrity
Displaying ongoing excellence in their job—responsiveness, problem‑solving skills, etc.
Sharing in our vision of continuing to perfect the event experience by demonstrating continued excellence in their job

In 2017, our very own Karine Plamondon was nominated for the title. Here is what an Experient team member had to say about Karine’s work:
“I have had the pleasure of working with Karine three different times over the last 10 years. Each experience has been exceptional, she is more than willing to go above and beyond for you and your group. She completely understands who Experient is and respects the relationship we have with our clients. Every convention center has their own unique rules and regulations and the Palais des congrès is no different. What makes them different is having a convention service manager like Karine to personally walk you through these regulations and help find ways to make them work for your individual groups. She makes sure all departments are giving high levels of customer service, helps negotiate internal costs in order to stay within the client’s budget, and is a great resource when contracting external suppliers. It is very rare to work with the same individual each time you return to a location (especially over a period of 10 years) but that is what I have had the pleasure of doing. I love knowing that when I return to Montreal, I’ll be working once again with a great partner and dear friend!” – Kim Rhodes, Senior Meeting and Event Manager
Congratulations Karine and keep up the good work!

	Creation of the Multisector Strategic Taskforce

    We can never stress this enough, but hosting international conventions enables Québec’s entire scientific community to shine internationally. Over 30 years ago, the Palais introduced its Ambassadors Club to help attract and hold these events in Montréal. Your involvement is vital so that Montréal may continue to be the Number One host city in North America for international conventions. You make a difference.
We recently announced the rollout of a Multisector Strategic Taskforce, whose members will represent eight of the city’s economic sectors:

Health and life sciences;
Natural and engineering sciences;
Energy and the environment;
IT and AI;
Transportation and logistics;
Aerospace; and
Workplace health and safety.

    When Andrée-Anne, Marc-André or Marie-France from the Palais’ business development team meet with prospective Ambassadors, first impressions are crucial. They need to quickly pitch the importance of their involvement and the quality of the support from the Palais they can look forward to every step of the process. During that crucial introduction, the prestige associated with attracting a conference to Montréal needs to be conveyed in the bat of an eye.

The Club recently gave its visual brand a makeover, with a new logo and an updated version of its explanatory leaflet. Cleaner, prestigious, distinctive and contemporary, the new image projects the powerful strength of those proudly involved in the Club.
The Ambassadors Club page on the Palais website has also been redesigned to include new content, like a videoclip featuring Ambassador Fabrice Labeau delivering a firsthand account of his experience.

    In addition to advocating for its members, the Ambassadors Club schedules activities aimed at strengthening the bond between the Club and its membership, recruiting and supporting new members, and making the most of existing networks to foster strategic alliances and continue to support Québec’s key sectors.
Now midway through the current action plan, the Palais team is proud to have surpassed its objectives, especially by giving Ambassadors increasingly more visibility. The list of achievements includes:

Advertorials in Le Devoir and Boardroom, and ads in various general and trade media
A total of 5 advertisements showcasing the work of Ambassadors Ferri Hassani, Fabrice Brunet, Wagdi Habashi, Sylvain Lanthier, Alexander Thiel and Fabrice Labeau

An awareness-raising campaign on LinkedIn
The Exchange Forum hosted jointly with the Fonds de recherche du Québec
The Ambassadors Club’s networking cocktail held during the Auto Show
The ongoing work of the Aerospace Taskforce and its succession subcommittee
Hosting the 2017 Recognition Award Gala where we introduced 9 new ambassadors and 4 star researchers
Partnerships developed with the FRQ and IRSST

By joining forces to attract major international conferences, the Palais and the Ambassadors continue to generate significant economic and intellectual wealth for Montréal and the province. Together, we are taking part in the scientific development of Montréal and promoting it internationally.

    In addition to welcoming over 11 million leisure and business tourists every year, Montréal has been topping the list of North American host cities for international conferences since 2011. A knowledge and innovation hub, Montréal continues to be a premier gathering place for scientific fields and economic sectors such life sciences, AI and aerospace.
As the main venue for these large-scale events, the Palais des congrès de Montréal has been enjoying record-breaking numbers in terms of attendance and square footage used. Between 2012 and 2018, there has been an overall increase of 30% in the number of people participating in the various events. Nearly 105,000 convention-goers have attended the various conventions held, accounting for economic benefits estimated at nearly $133.5 M for Montréal and Québec.
Both certified under the AIPC Quality Standards program for management excellence and ASTM certified as a green convention site, the Palais is also shortlisted for the AIPC APEX World’s Best Congress Centre award.

	The Palais’ clients help reduce the climate footprint of events

		Social responsability
					
    
    At the Palais des congrès de Montréal, there’s a special bond that exists between advancing sustainability and continually improving our service.
Each time a client fills out a survey on the quality of our services, the Palais gives $10 to Planetair to buy Gold Standard carbon credits. So in fact, your feedback not only helps shape our actions, it also contributes to measurably reducing the carbon footprint of events hosted at the Palais.
51,1 tons of CO2e were offset in 2017-2018. The 5 minutes required to complete the survey was time well spent! Since 2012, the CO2e offset made possible by the Palais’ clients exceeds 227 tons.
Purchasing carbon credits is investing in renewable energy, energy efficiency and reforestation projects and helping to reduce the greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere. Gold Standard credits, which meet the highest standards on the carbon market, ensure that the investment will lead to a tangible reduction in your climate impacts and also lead to sustainable development for local communities (such as better living standards, knowledge transfer, job creation and pollution reduction).
Thank you all for your contribution!

	Putting on a show for 35 years

		Exhibitions and tradeshows
					
    
    
The Palais des congrès de Montréal turns 35 in May 2018. Over the years, it has hosted over 1,400 consumer and trade shows, adding up to 163,000+ exhibitors and over 10 million visitors. This has helped generate over $1.8 billion for the Québec economy! Virtually every subject has been tackled, from serious issues to more unusual fare, including horse auctions, a gardening show, a sanitation fair, and the “Palais des merveilles” exhibition.
The first exhibitions happened the month after the Palais opened in June 1983. They were “Sous-traitance Transport 1983” and “Festival de la Photo 1983,” a trade show and a consumer show, respectively. Many are those that have amassed a very long track record of hosting their event at the Palais:

The most impressive is the Motorcycle Show: 36 editions between May 1983 and May 2018
Let’s Get Married: 34 annual shows at the Palais
Salon du timbre et de la monnaie: 36 times
Expo-Prestige: 31 editions

Consumer shows and trade shows are deeply entrenched in the history of the Palais and have provided visitors with many unforgettable moments.

Cheers to the 25th Mondial de la Bière de Montréal!
From June 6 to 9, 2018, the Palais des congrès de Montréal will host the 25th edition of the Mondial de la Bière, an international beer festival. A Palais regular for the last 5 years, this unique event kicks off the summer season by attracting an average of 85,000 visitors each year.
Tastings, workshops and tours are among the activities on the menu, some of which are held outdoors on the Palais Esplanade. The nearby Place-d’Armes metro station is also a big advantage, allowing festival-goers to commute safely.
Let’s all raise a glass to the Mondial de la Bière!

Comiccon: 10 years already!
It started as a meeting of comic book collectors in a small room of the Palais, and evolved into a Comiccon that draws 50,000 people each year. What a remarkable journey for the Montréal Comiccon team!
The 2018 edition will mark the 10th year of this incredible achievement. Over the years, the Comiccon and Palais teams have developed a level of cooperation that has allowed the event to grow with each passing year and realize its full potential. Indeed, the event has occupied the Palais in its entirety since 2015.
To celebrate, guests appearing for the 10th anniversary will include legends such as Chuck Norris and David Duchovny.
