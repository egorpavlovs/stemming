	Experient Supplier of the Year Nominee

	 
		communications
		Conventions, Palais des congrès de Montréal
					
    
    The Palais’ event managers work as suppliers to numerous professional convention organizers (PCO) throughout the year to set up their events at the Palais. They develop working relationships and form one-off teams to contribute to the success of the event.
To recognize the outstanding job done by their suppliers who continually goes above and beyond, Experient, a global meeting and events management company, has developed the Supplier of the Year award process. The Experient Supplier of the Year Awards are based on several criteria:

Making an extraordinary contribution to Experient and their clients’ success
Displaying outstanding character and integrity
Displaying ongoing excellence in their job—responsiveness, problem‑solving skills, etc.
Sharing in our vision of continuing to perfect the event experience by demonstrating continued excellence in their job

In 2017, our very own Karine Plamondon was nominated for the title. Here is what an Experient team member had to say about Karine’s work:
“I have had the pleasure of working with Karine three different times over the last 10 years. Each experience has been exceptional, she is more than willing to go above and beyond for you and your group. She completely understands who Experient is and respects the relationship we have with our clients. Every convention center has their own unique rules and regulations and the Palais des congrès is no different. What makes them different is having a convention service manager like Karine to personally walk you through these regulations and help find ways to make them work for your individual groups. She makes sure all departments are giving high levels of customer service, helps negotiate internal costs in order to stay within the client’s budget, and is a great resource when contracting external suppliers. It is very rare to work with the same individual each time you return to a location (especially over a period of 10 years) but that is what I have had the pleasure of doing. I love knowing that when I return to Montreal, I’ll be working once again with a great partner and dear friend!” – Kim Rhodes, Senior Meeting and Event Manager
Congratulations Karine and keep up the good work!
