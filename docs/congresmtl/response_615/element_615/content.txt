	The Palais Ambassadors Club acquires new members

	 
		communications
		Ambassador’s Club, Palais des congrès de Montréal
					
    
    The Ambassadors Club added to their ranks at the 2018 Recognition Award Gala, a lively evening attended by Québec Minister of Tourism Caroline Proulx. The 18 newly minted members honoured on November 8 were appointed as Ambassadors for their active involvement in bringing an international conference to the Palais. The 12 major events these Ambassadors helped secure will generate over $73 million in economic benefits for Montréal and Québec thanks to the 32,000 business tourists they will attract and who will book 88,000+ room nights in the city’s hotels. The Ambassadors Club’s membership has now grown to 327 inspiring women and men.
The Recognition Award Gala salutes the exceptional contribution of influential and dynamic figures from the key segments of excellence of Montréal’s economy, who step outside of their usual professions to actively bring international conferences to the city, and thus help generate significant economic and intellectual benefits for the city and province.
