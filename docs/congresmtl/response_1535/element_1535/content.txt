    Over 3,000 participants contributed to the success of the 3rd annual Rendez-vous du Savoir, which ran from November 14 to 15 at the Palais des congrès de Montréal. This forum on higher learning, presented by Desjardins in association with Raymond Chabot Grant Thornton and CGI, generated fruitful discussions aimed at strengthening ties between universities and businesses.
According to Dr. Pavel Hamet, full professor at Université de Montréal’s Faculty of Medicine, world-renowned researcher and the event’s co-spokesperson, everyone agrees on the importance of the academic and corporate worlds working together toward an increasingly innovative and competitive society. “As evidenced through the various discussions, it is essential that we consolidate ties between research chairs, research centres and businesses so we can share knowledge more effectively. Research has contributed a great deal to corporations, and they are realizing this more and more.”
It is a realization corroborated by a survey conducted during the Rendez-vous du Savoir by the Board of Trade of Metropolitan Montréal (BTMM), in tandem with the Léger Marketing firm. The survey reveals that nearly nine out of 10 research centres and chairs having worked with private corporations intend to pursue their joint collaboration, which they deem relevant and necessary to moving their work forward.
Once again this year, the Rendez-vous du Savoir had a schedule filled with new features thanks to the addition of new sponsors, including Raymond Chabot Grant Thornton, which hosted a breakfast on the topic of joint business-university collaborations and their influence on the development of Northern Québec.
The contribution of young researchers to society was also acknowledged. Fondation Desjardins, which offers more university scholarships than any other private foundation in Québec, paid tribute to 45 university students from all over the province. The work of four star researchers, winners of the Ça mérite d’être reconnu! competition, was also recognized during the Palais des congrès de Montréal Recognition Award Gala, which helped close the Rendez-vous du Savoir in style.

The Palais’ Recognition Award Gala also honoured five newly appointed Ambassadors. Between now and 2016, the events they attracted will generate over $34.6 million for the city’s economy. The International Achievement Award was another highlight of the evening, with the recipient, Bombardier, garnering a vibrant tribute for contributing to Montréal’s growth.
The Recognition Award Gala, which this year was Level 2 certified for sustainable event management by the BNQ standards council of Québec, was held with the support of Tourisme Québec, the Desjardins Group, Tourisme Montréal, AVW-TELAV, Kloda Focus, Raymond Chabot Grant Thornton and CGI. The 3rd annual Rendez-vous du Savoir could not have asked for a more fitting closing event.
See you in Fall 2013 for the 4th annual Rendez-vous du Savoir!
