                          The Palais des congrès de Montréal is ready to host the first ever North American edition of Smart City Expo, from March 25 to 27, 2015. Delegates will discuss the most advanced technology to build the smart cities of tomorrow. “Our teams pride themselves on delivering productivity-driven event experiences, which is why they always have their ear to the ground, anticipating the needs of today and tomorrow,” says Raymond Larivée, President and CEO of the Société du Palais des congrès de Montréal. “The Palais is located in the centre of a city known for its booming high-tech economy and concentration of high-tech jobs (127,000). We are therefore pleased to welcome such a prestigious event focused on determining the urban policies that will improve the lives of local and visiting citizens, including business tourists passing through Montréal.”
Smart Schedule
Organized by Eventium, jointly with Fira Barcelona, Smart City MTL will bring together 600 convention-goers and 30 exhibitors expected to book over 1,400 room nights in Montréal hotels, while the event will generate nearly $1,000,000 for the city’s and province’s economy. After Barcelona, Kyoto and Bogota, Montréal will now be joining the ranks of smart cities by hosting 80 experts from 30 countries who will tackle topics such as urban resilience, sustainable mobility, energy and climate change, and open government. “This international congress will deliver an opportunity to raise the importance of civic engagement in the future of our cities and also foster discussion on the collaborative tools that will help our cities move forward,” mentions François Morin, Eventium CEO and organizer of Smart City MTL.
Sweeping IT modernization project
The IT project the Palais undertook in 2012 has made the convention and exhibition centre an event technology leader, making it possible, for instance, for the thousands of delegates attending the World Congress on Information Technology in October 2012 to enjoy a wireless network of the utmost dependability, robustness and speed. A reminder that the Palais des congrès de Montréal IT project included:

Modernizing the network infrastructure to enable 20,000 devices to connect simultaneously;


Deploying a digital signage network spanning 90 55” HD displays and a 90 sq. ft. video wall;


An e-commerce portal for exhibitors; and


A customizable mobile event app, jointly developed with CGI.

The Palais’ event technology has already won awards, including the Digital Signage Expo APEX top prize in the Event Venues category in recognition of the quality and flexibility of its digital signage technology.
