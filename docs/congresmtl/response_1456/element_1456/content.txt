Salon carrières et emplois La Presse, April 8 and 9


National Franchise and Business Opportunities Show, May 2 and 3


Salon de l’immigration et de l’intégration au Québec, June 9 and 10

“We are proud to contribute to the province’s economic development by generating some $250M in economic benefits annually, and also by making it possible for local businesses to recruit the workforce they need to succeed and prosper,” said Raymond Larivée, President and CEO of the Palais des congrès de Montréal.
The Palais, accessible and practical
Located in the downtown core, the Palais is easily accessible either by car, public transit or on foot, especially since it is directly linked to the Montréal metro system and the underground city. The shows’ visitors will also have the opportunity to discover the products and services available year round at the Galeries du Palais, where dozens of merchants are always conveniently open for Montréal tourists, convention-goers and workers in the downtown core and Old Montréal, rain, snow or shine! Visit lesgaleriesdupalais.com to learn more.
Galeries du Palais photo contest
Visitors will be able to enter the contest until April 15, 2015 for a chance to win a $500 travel credit from Voyage Hone. Details on lesgaleriesdupalais.com.
