                          The Palais des congrès is rolling out the red carpet this January 31 and February 1, 2015 for the 35th Salon de la Mariée. Over 5,000 visitors are expected to attend the popular consumer show known for the diversity and quality of its 160 exhibitors. The annual event attracts hundreds of companies specialized in weddings, honeymoons and interior design, not to mention thousands of future brides and grooms.
“Our spacious event rooms and exhibition halls, our downtown location and the expertise of our staff render the Palais des congrès the perfect spot for hosting a consumer show of this size and scope,” says Raymond Larivée, President and CEO of the Palais des congrès de Montréal. The 35th edition of the Salon de la Mariée will occupy nearly 50,000 sq. ft. of versatile space equipped with the latest state-of-the-art technology.
The Palais is easily accessible either by car, public transit or on foot, especially since it is directly linked to the Montréal metro system and the underground city. Salon de la Mariée visitors will also have the opportunity to discover the products and services available year round at the Galeries du Palais, where dozens of merchants are conveniently open for Montréal tourists, convention-goers and workers in the downtown area and Old Montréal, rain, snow or shine!
