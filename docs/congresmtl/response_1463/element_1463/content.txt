                          After launching a major IT modernization project that has made the Palais des congrès de Montréal one of North America’s leading high-tech convention and exhibition centres for organizers, exhibitors and participants seeking a state-of-the-art environment, the Palais is now teaming up with CGI, naming the global IT leader as its official provider of customizable mobile event applications.
“As a North American leader in event technologies, we are proud to deliver an experience focused on productivity, dependability and user support. We chose CGI so our customers can rest assured they are getting the very best in digital and mobile event solutions,” indicated Raymond Larivée, President and CEO of the Palais des congrès. “The business tourism industry realized immediately just how much event organizers, exhibitors and participants would benefit from mobile applications, and with CGI, our customers will be able to take full advantage of this,” added Élaine Legault, Event Management Director at the Palais des congrès.
CGI will be tasked with developing customizable mobile apps that will deliver a value-added experience to event participants, sponsors and exhibitors. This will include organizers being able to enjoy an eco-friendly digital interface to keep in touch and inform visiting delegates. According to one study1, organizers who produce content before, during and after an event significantly improve the quality of the experience for the participants and sponsors. With 68 000 professionals worldwide, including 7000 in Québec, CGI will be able to work alongside its international customers on every continent by adapting the mobile app specifically designed for their event to each new edition.
By working with CGI for their mobile app, event organizers will benefit from a wide range of customizable digital services, such as online registration. “CGI is pleased to team up with such a renowned organization so we may offer their vast roster of customers mobile technologies to help them manage their events, solutions that we designed and that we continue to move forward,” stated Jacques Caron, Vice-President, Commercial sector, Technology and Innovation, Greater Montreal business unit, CGI.
Over and above the customizable event app being jointly developed with CGI, the Palais des congrès also provides cutting-edge event technologies today’s event planners and delegates simply find invaluable, including an e-commerce portal for event promoters and exhibitors.
The Palais’ event technologies have already garnered awards, including the Digital Signage Expo APEX top prize for digital signage quality and flexibility. The Palais’ high-tech environment also earned it a Best in Show 2014 award from the Professional Convention Management Association.
