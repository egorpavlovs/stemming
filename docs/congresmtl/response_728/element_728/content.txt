    Hosting 450 guests for an evening that combines an award ceremony honouring 22 people and a gastronomic affair staged by 8 different kitchen teams is no small order!

Which is why we call a seasoned event production firm: Idées au cube (ID3). Each year for nearly 20 years, ID3 has been up to the challenge of staging a uniquely majestic experience for those in attendance. Putting together and producing the Recognition Award Gala requires 6 months of hard work and great ideas. The Gala must unfold like clockwork, so nothing is left to chance!
The ID3 team started by picking the right templates and projection surfaces. This year, they added a technical challenge by lapping conventional screens onto flexible structures to create a wave effect as tribute to the visual theme chosen for the 2016 Gala. Then, various settings were developed for the different parts of the Gala to tie together the sequence of colours and undulations. The motif of the gastronomic symphony was also orchestrated with a more organic and monochrome visual concept in mind.
Meanwhile, the Palais team was busy meeting the Ambassadors for interviews and photo shoots, booking the hotels and their chefs, selecting the wines, overseeing the room’s setup and decoration, preparing the trophies, handling invitations and seating arrangements, drafting speeches, and preparing all the printed material and other communications surrounding the event.

The 2016 Gala by the numbers
