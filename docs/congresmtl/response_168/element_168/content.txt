    The Montreal International Auto Show at Palais des congrès de Montréal is just days away, and the 200,000-odd visitors expected from January 18 to 27 will be able to attend free science presentations for the general public at the Hydro-Québec Stage within The Generator, a new zone dedicated to electric mobility.
Among the variety of general audience presentations offered by FLO, CAA-Québec, and Équiterre, there are those organized by the new Centre Déclic. In plain language that everyone can understand, the sessions will cover various facets of electric mobility, explaining concepts and fostering dialogue between scientists and the public.
See the program of events put together and facilitated by science journalist and communicator Valérie Borde, who founded Centre Déclic.
The Future for Intelligent Cars (in French only)
January 19 and 27, 2019, at 11:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m.
The cars of tomorrow will be autonomous, connected, and intelligent. But what exactly does that mean? Is it true that we’re on the verge of a new era in transportation? Which technologies are on the starting line? Join our researchers for a ride into the future!
 
The Battery Challenge  (in French only)
January 20, 2019, at 11:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m.
Batteries limit the range of electric cars as much as they limit how much time we can spend on our cell phones. Why is it so hard to produce high-performance batteries? What’s the outlook for progress? How does a battery actually work?
 
An all-electric future? (in French only)
January 26, 2019, at 11:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m.
There’s more and more talk about electric cars, but what about buses, trucks, and other big vehicles? Can we make everything electric? What new charging technologies are in the pipeline?
