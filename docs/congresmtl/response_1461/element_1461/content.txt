                          From July 3 to 5, 2015, the Montreal Comiccon will descend on the Palais des congrès and take over the entire venue, a privilege reserved for only a handful of events each year! The event will actually occupy nearly 1.5 million sq. ft., which is twice the floor surface it required when first hosted at the Palais in 2012. The turnout for Montreal Comiccon keeps getting bigger, which speaks to just how popular this major event has become, attracting thousands of visitors along with big stars from the industry. After doubling their attendance in 2014, organizers are expecting 60,000 people this year for what promises to be a very lively affair.
“Montreal Comiccon’s fast growth at the Palais des congrès clearly shows how flexible and versatile our facilities are. We are proud to be playing an active role in developing what has become a signature event on Montréal’s cultural calendar, by providing a colourful venue just perfect for dynamic events like Comiccon,” declared Raymond Larivée, President and CEO of the Palais des congrès. “The Palais des congrès team is ready to host the planet’s superheroes for the entire long weekend. As for the visitors, it’ll be a summer event they won’t soon forget,” mentioned Catherine Paul, Associate Director of Business Development and also in charge of the exhibition market.
The 2015 Montreal Comiccon will feature legends from the worlds of sci-fi, fantasy, horror, gaming and comic books. Numerous international stars will be participating in conferences, workshops, photo and autograph sessions. “Because of the Palais’ facilities and teams, we can focus all our efforts on the schedule knowing full well that the technical and technological aspects of the event are being meticulously looked after,” indicated Alex La Prova, Co-President of Montréal Comiccon.
Comiccon visitors will also be able to take advantage of the products and services in the Galeries du Palais, where dozens of merchants are always conveniently open for tourists in the downtown core and Old Montréal, rain, snow or shine!
