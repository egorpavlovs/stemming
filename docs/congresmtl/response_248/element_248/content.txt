Montreal outranks all other cities in the Americas for international meetings
Montréal
 earned the top positions for hosting international association meetings
 in the 2013 rankings of two prestigious international organizations: 
the Union of International Associations (UIA) and the International 
Congress and Convention Association (ICCA).
For
 a third consecutive year, the UIA ranked Montréal first in the Americas
 for international association meetings. The UIA’s annual International 
Meetings Statistics Report compiles data from its database of over 
66,000 organizations in 300 countries and territories. It identifies 
events held over at least 3 days with more than 300 participants, or a 
trade show component, with at least 40% international delegates.
And
 for a second year in a row, Montréal topped ICCA’s “Country and City 
Rankings” list, finishing first in North America for international 
association meetings. Each year, ICCA’s research team analyzes almost 
12,000 regularly-occurring association events of 50 people or more that 
rotate between at least three countries. And once again in 2013, 
Montréal topped the list, ahead of major meeting destinations such as 
Toronto, Vancouver, New York, Boston, San Francisco, Washington D.C., 
San Diego, and Chicago.
So
 what’s the secret to this international success? Teamwork. The Palais 
des congrès de Montréal works closely with Tourisme Montréal and the 
city’s meeting industry leaders to constantly raise the bar, offering 
event planners a full range of personalized services and cutting-edge 
event technologies to make each meeting hosted at the Palais a smashing 
success.
A
 city that works as a team, a vibrant local community and a world-class 
convention centre in the heart of an exciting destination that attendees
 love – no wonder Montréal continues to be the top pick for planners of 
international association meetings.  [ Read in your browser ]
