                          For a fifth consecutive year, Montréal ranks first in the Americas for international events, according to the International Meetings Statistics Report for the Year 2015 released by the Union of International Association (UIA), representing yet another outstanding performance. Overall, the city hosted 108 international events in 2015, up 29% from 2014.
This is an enviable position given how competitive the industry is worldwide. Montréal outranked all major U.S. cities by hosting:

- 42% more international events than New York City (ranked first in the U.S.); and
- 59% more than Washington DC, the U.S. capital.

Within Canada, the city clearly dominated by hosting over half (52%) the international events held in the country’s three major cities, i.e. Toronto, Vancouver and Montréal.
“As Montréal’s main venue for large-scale conventions, the Palais is proud of the city’s standing among the world’s leading destinations. Everyone in the business tourism industry keeps mobilizing, and this is essential to secure big international events so we may continue to be steadfast in our pursuit of generating ever more intellectual benefits and tourism revenue for Montréal,” declared Raymond Larivée, President and CEO of the Palais des congrès. “We’ve earned the AIPC Gold Quality Standards certification, the highest in the convention industry, and have been named a finalist for the AIPC* World’s Best Congress Centre award, so the Palais is clearly thoroughly equipped to handle major events,” he added.
“Montréal attracts thousands of business tourists each year, thus entrenching its standing as a tourism leader in the Americas. At Tourisme Montréal, we are committed to working alongside our clients to ensure they host successful events and to give them a unique experience. I would like to point out the hard work of our local tourism industry in maintaining Montréal’s Number One ranking at the top of the list of leading host cities for international events,” stated Yves Lalumière, President and CEO of Tourisme Montréal.
For the 2015-16 year, the Palais des congrès welcomed almost 57,000 participants who attended 25 international events**, generating nearly $118,000,000 in tourism revenues for Montréal.
