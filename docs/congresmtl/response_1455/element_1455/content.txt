                          The Palais des congrès de Montréal recently confirmed the city will be hosting three large-scale international events expected to generate over $15 million for the province’s economy via the more than 6,500 business tourists they will attract. These agreements, secured with the collaboration of Tourisme Montréal, will account, among other things, for over 15,000 room nights being booked in Montréal hotels.

“North America’s leading host city for international conventions for the last three years1, Montréal affords international associations seeking a vibrant university and economic community, combined with a state-of-the-art convention centre perfectly located in the heart of a dynamic city, a truly unique environment,” indicated Raymond Larivée, President and CEO of the Palais des congrès de Montréal. He added: “The team in charge of developing our convention business did a remarkable job in the field, and the strategies we’ve rolled out are clearly working.” A finalist shortlisted for the World’s Best Congress Centre award2 in 2013, the Palais in on par with the planet’s top convention centres, with its versatile infrastructure, event technologies and the quality of its event planning and mentoring spearheading the list of advantages.
Each year, Plant Biology brings together members of the American Society of Plant Biologists for workshops and conferences focused on the advancement of plant science. As for the International Society of Hypnosis, it hosts numerous events, but its triennial congress is its biggest educational and scientific gathering. It is where the members of its 30 constituent societies come together to share clinical and scientific data, teach and update their skills. Finally, the members of the Psychonomic Society are experimental psychologists among whose numbers are some of the most distinguished researchers in the field. What brings them together is studying the basic fundamental properties of how the mind works by using behavioural techniques to better understand mental functioning.
“2017, a milestone year marking Montréal’s 375th anniversary, will be the ideal time for the Palais to host numerous large international and national conventions, and we have every intention of pursuing this idea by confirming more major events for the coming years,” mentioned Luc Charbonneau, Director of Business Development and Strategic Alliances at the Palais des congrès.
Since it opened in 1983, the Palais des congrès de Montréal has hosted over 7,000 events and visitors who have booked 4.7 million room nights in hotels across the city. The Palais’ operations have therefore generated $5.3 billion in economic benefits, thus making a significant impact on the province’s economy. Tourism activity is an essential economic driver for Québec, creating added value in more than 180 sectors and generating 365,000 direct jobs3.
