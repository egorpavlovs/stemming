                          The first ever International Congress on Personalized Health Care is in full swing at the Palais des congrès de Montréal. Hundreds of multidisciplinary professionals will be descending on the convention centre for this world first, created in Montréal by Daniel Bouthillier, an Appointed Ambassador of the Palais and Executive Director of the Quebec Network for Personalized Health Care and the President of the Palais Ambassadors Club, Dr. Pavel Hamet, jointly with the Palais des congrès de Montréal. 
“Ranked the top host city in the Americas by the Union of International Associations and Gold Quality Standards certified by the AIPC*, Montréal and the Palais are both well positioned internationally, while continuing to create significant economic and intellectual wealth for all of Québec,” indicated Raymond Larivée, President and CEO of the Société du Palais des congrès de Montréal. “The life sciences account for nearly 40% of the events we host at the Palais and we are firmly committed to the work of continuing to advance this major economic sector for Montréal,” he added.
The medicine of the future
Congress President and Emeritus Ambassador of the Palais des congrès Ambassadors Club, Dr. Pavel Hamet describes what sparked the organization of the International Congress on Personalized Health Care: “We are at the dawn of a new era of medicine that will redefine healthcare management. Recent breakthroughs and advancements in molecular biology, genomics and data management enable the development of a more specific medical approach focusing on individual genetic makeup in its relationship with the environment.” Because applying this type of medical approach raises technological, financial, ethical and legal issues, the Congress will aim to address these and also evaluate the uses for this medicine.
Undeniable expertise
The Palais des congrès de Montréal has helped stage major events related to the life sciences for over 30 years. In 2015, it hosted 23 national and international events linked to this sector of excellence. All told, these conventions, meetings, consumer shows and trade shows have brought almost 40,000 participants and business tourists to Montréal. These activities, along with the more than 42,000 room nights they generated in the city’s hotels, have amounted to nearly $68 million in tourism revenues for Montréal and Québec.
