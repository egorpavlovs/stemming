Montréal’s cultural mecca



                        A city of culture
Anyone who wants to get a taste of the quintessential Montréal urban experience heads to the Quartier des spectacles, the city’s entertainment district a few minutes from the Palais des congrès. Spanning a square kilometre in the eastern section of downtown, it is where many renowned international festivals and a plethora of cultural activities take place.
An enthusiastic artistic community
With over 80 cultural indoor and outdoor venues, there’s always something to see in the Quartier des spectacles, from cinema and circus acts to visual art performances and variety shows. Walk around this area and you’re only a stone’s throw from an assortment of performance halls, bar venues, media centres, museums, cinemas, and more!
