A renewed Recognition Award Gala!

The Palais des congrès de Montréal’s next Recognition Award Gala, scheduled for February 5, 2015, will feature a revamped format as we celebrate the excellence and international reputation of our vibrant city.
Still one of the marquee events of the Québec tourism industry, the 2015 Recognition Award Gala will honour 15 individuals who helped attract 10 international conventions to the Palais and Montréal for the coming years. These events are expected to draw over 40,000 delegates to the city and generate an estimated nearly $129 million for the economy.
Based on the theme Tomorrow’s Leaders, this memorable evening will also provide us with an opportunity to reward the exceptional work of three researchers jointly with the Fonds de recherche du Québec, and to mark the 30th Anniversary of the Ambassadors Club. The Gala’s new format will now combine the award ceremony with the gastronomy portion of the evening. This unique culinary experience will enable guests to enjoy dishes concocted by the chefs of seven upscale hotels and by Capital Catering. A delightful experience, and a feast for the eyes and the palate!
Tickets for this exclusive event, which will be attended by 350 guests, are now available for pre-sale. Quantities are limited so take advantage of this exceptional opportunity to invite your colleagues and preferred clients.
