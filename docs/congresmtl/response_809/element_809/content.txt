                                        Hereâ€™s a roundup of figures that speak volumes about how favourable 2011-2012 has been for the Palais, in the wake of a strategic plan focused on business performance and revitalizing the customer experience:
                                        Events hosted
                                        
                                          We broke attendance records, having hosted 368 events that attracted over 657,000 participants and generated over 147,000 room night in the cityâ€™s hotels.
                                          More than $200 M in economic spinoffs were generated over and above the intellectual spinoffs.
                                        
                                        Events confirmed for future years
                                        
                                          Overall, we confirmed 404 events for the coming years, up 6% over last year and nearly 27% since 2009-2010.
                                          These will draw nearly 425,000 business tourists to MontrÃ©al, thatâ€™s 15% more than we attracted last year.
                                          They will help generate over $333 M for the cityâ€™s economy, or 14% more than in 2010-2011.
                                        
                                        The Palais topped off its very remarkable year by winning the very first Ulysse award in the Green Event category, last April during the MontrÃ©al edition of the Grand Prix du tourisme quÃ©becois. The award recognizes outstanding achievement in green convention planning and hosting.
