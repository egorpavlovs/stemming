                          More than 200,000 visitors are expected to converge on the Palais des congrès de Montréal from January 15 to 24, 2016 for the 48th Montréal International Auto Show. The show, which is the province’s largest consumer show and the automotive event of the year for Montréalers, will occupy nearly all of the Palais, whose venue and expertise are ideally suited for exhibitions of this size and scope. It is the event’s 14th year at the Palais.
“It is an honour for our team to contribute to the success of the Auto Show year after year, and to provide a stage for the city’s automotive community to shine,” stated Raymond Larivée, President and CEO of the Palais des congrès de Montréal. “It is the event automotive enthusiasts wait for, and it attracts thousands of visitors from all over the province every time,” he added. A total of 60+ exhibitors are expected.
Revving up for the event!
The Show and Palais team will be hard at work handling the more than 425 trailer and specialty trucks that will be passing through the loading dock during the setup, delivering the massive fleets of vehicles and equipment from carmakers and other exhibitors. It is a logistical process that changes every year and has been fine-tuned since 2002! The Palais’ versatile facilities are perfect for this type of consumer show, whose sizeable booths can raise some interesting challenges installation-wise. For instance, over 600 rigging points will be required to suspend the hulking structures and décors.
Shows of all types
In addition to the Auto Show, the Palais des congrès de Montréal will also be hosting around 20 more consumer shows in 2016, on topics ranging from motorcycles, weddings and food, to the outdoors and jobs. Some of the interesting new features for 2016 include:

The National Wedding Show, January 30 and 31, 2016;
The Montreal RV Show, February 4 to 7, 2016;
The Montreal Man Show, March 10 to 13, 2016; and
The Salon de la course à pieds, March 12 and 13, 2016.

The Palais, accessible and practical
Located in the downtown core, the Palais is easily accessible either by car, public transit or on foot, especially since it is directly linked to the Montréal metro system and the underground city. Auto Show visitors will also have the opportunity to discover the products and services available year round at the Galeries du Palais, where dozens of merchants are always conveniently open for Montréal tourists, convention-goers and workers in the area, rain, snow or shine!
