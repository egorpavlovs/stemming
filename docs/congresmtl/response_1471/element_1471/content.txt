                          From November 26 to December 6, 2015, the Palais des congrès de Montréal will host the 6th annual Nutcracker Market and light up the Palais shopping promenade with Holiday Season magic. Visitors can look forward to an enchanting shopping experience, and great finds, gift ideas and sweet treats from the 96 exhibiting merchants.
“The Nutcracker Market beautifully showcases creations from Québec artists and craftspeople”, emphasized Raymond Larivée, President and CEO of the Palais des congrès de Montréal. “It’s a nice way to support their work and also help a charitable cause.” In fact, 10% of the merchants’ sales and all revenues earned by the Nutcracker Market will go to The Nutcracker Fund for Children. The organizers raise funds to enable children from underprivileged neighbourhoods to attend educational workshops and a performance of the Nutcracker ballet.
The Palais, accessible and practical
Located in the downtown core, the Palais is easily accessible either by car, public transit or on foot, especially since it is directly linked to the Montréal metro system and the underground city. Nutcracker Market visitors will also have the opportunity to discover the products and services available year round at the Galeries du Palais, where dozens of merchants are always conveniently open for Montréal tourists, convention-goers and workers in the downtown area and Old Montréal, rain, snow or shine!
