                                        If you’re planning an event, you should know that the Palais’ versatile and ultramodern facilities house virtually infinite possibilities spanning 551,520 sq. ft. The pink-treed Lipstick Forest, the rainbow-coloured glass façade, the 3 terraces and the 3 ballrooms spearhead the additional 113 rooms and spaces that can be shaped around your  gala, banquet, meeting, convention, exhibition or any other large-scale function.
                                        The Palais tops the list of convention centres in Canada in terms of available meeting space, at nearly 200,000 sq. ft., not to mention the 400,000 sq. ft. in exhibition space capable of accommodating up to 1,950 booths. 
                                        The Palais’ upcoming consumer shows include the D-Clic Photo and Video Show, 2011 Go Global Expo, Career and Job Fair in collaboration with La Presse, Engineer-IT Career Fair / Technology Career Fair, 2011 Grande Dégustation de Montréal, 2011 National Franchise and Business Opportunities Show and Nutcracker Market. 
                                        It’ll be an “eventful” fall... Be a part of it and seize the immense potential our prestigious venue has to offer!
