                          The Chief Scientist of Québec, Rémi Quirion, and the President of the Palais des congrès de Montréal Ambassadors Club, Hany Moustapha, unveiled the winners of the Palais des congrès de Montréal Ambassadors Club and Fonds de recherche du Québec (FRQ) International Conference Organization Support Funding Competition, which recognizes the work of researchers who lend their support to the process of organizing an international scientific conference. They are:

Denis deBlois of Université de Montréal
7th FIP Pharmaceutical Sciences World Congress
Pierrette Gaudreau of Université de Montréal
12e Congrès International Francophone de Gériatrie et Gérontologie
François Mathieu-Potvin of Université Laval
25th IIR International Congress of Refrigeration

“Partnering with the FRQ enables Montréal to take advantage of major economic and intellectual benefits. By combining our efforts and recognizing the work of people who actively contribute to the organization of international scientific conferences in our city, we are ensuring Montréal will continue to be at the top of the list of cities in the Americas that host the most international conferences,” stated Robert Mercure, President and CEO of the Palais des congrès de Montréal.
A forum on equity, diversity and inclusion
The ceremony took place during the annual exchange forum the Fonds de recherche du Québec (FRQ) jointly organizes with the Palais des congrès de Montréal. Titled  Diverse voices: An added value for scientific conferences, the fourth edition of the forum brought together nearly 70 participants, who tackled equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) and finding ways of applying these principles to the international conference organizing process.
“Bringing the principles of EDI across the entire research ecosystem, including how we disseminate findings, is something we’re focusing on at the FRQ. Scientific conferences are important activities for researchers, because they foster networking, the sharing of ideas, science careers and the spread of knowledge and skills. They also provide an opportunity to present and discuss best research practices,” added Rémi Quirion, the Chief Scientist of Québec.
