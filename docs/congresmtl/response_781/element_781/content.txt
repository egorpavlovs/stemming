    This fall, three new consumer shows joined the roster of exhibitions at the Palais des congrès de Montréal, thus contributing to the city’s rich calendar of events! Together, they attracted over 22,000 Montréalers eager to learn more about various topics.

A thriving success for the Montreal Vegan Festival 
Although in its 5th year, this was the Montreal Vegan Festival’s first time at the Palais. It was attended by thousands of vegans, vegetarians, foodies and visitors simply curious about veganism. Last October 20 and 21, the consumer show drew more visitors than expected, who were treated to 100+ exhibitors on hand to showcase their products. Congratulations to the volunteers behind this amazing success!
The Sailing Fair drops anchor at the Palais 
On November 3, various sailboat masts brushed past the ceilings of the Palais for the first time while sailing enthusiasts watched in amazement. For its 3rd edition, the event invited a number of renowned keynote speakers, and held informative and interactive workshops for the avid boaters who assembled at the Palais.
The death expo that sparked a conversation
The idea was to break taboos and facilitate discussions about subject matters related to death. It would appear the Salon de la mort succeeded on both counts on November 3 and 4. The organizers chose to host their very first show at the Palais, and the colourful and reassuring environment did not disappoint in fostering conversations with the many exhibitors, who fielded sensitive questions from thousands of visitors.
