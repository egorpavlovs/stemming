	The Palais’ clients help reduce the climate footprint of events

	 
		communications
		Social responsability
					
    
    At the Palais des congrès de Montréal, there’s a special bond that exists between advancing sustainability and continually improving our service.
Each time a client fills out a survey on the quality of our services, the Palais gives $10 to Planetair to buy Gold Standard carbon credits. So in fact, your feedback not only helps shape our actions, it also contributes to measurably reducing the carbon footprint of events hosted at the Palais.
51,1 tons of CO2e were offset in 2017-2018. The 5 minutes required to complete the survey was time well spent! Since 2012, the CO2e offset made possible by the Palais’ clients exceeds 227 tons.
Purchasing carbon credits is investing in renewable energy, energy efficiency and reforestation projects and helping to reduce the greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere. Gold Standard credits, which meet the highest standards on the carbon market, ensure that the investment will lead to a tangible reduction in your climate impacts and also lead to sustainable development for local communities (such as better living standards, knowledge transfer, job creation and pollution reduction).
Thank you all for your contribution!
