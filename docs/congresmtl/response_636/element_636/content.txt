Cheers to the 25th Mondial de la Bière de Montréal!
From June 6 to 9, 2018, the Palais des congrès de Montréal will host the 25th edition of the Mondial de la Bière, an international beer festival. A Palais regular for the last 5 years, this unique event kicks off the summer season by attracting an average of 85,000 visitors each year.
Tastings, workshops and tours are among the activities on the menu, some of which are held outdoors on the Palais Esplanade. The nearby Place-d’Armes metro station is also a big advantage, allowing festival-goers to commute safely.
Let’s all raise a glass to the Mondial de la Bière!

Comiccon: 10 years already!
It started as a meeting of comic book collectors in a small room of the Palais, and evolved into a Comiccon that draws 50,000 people each year. What a remarkable journey for the Montréal Comiccon team!
The 2018 edition will mark the 10th year of this incredible achievement. Over the years, the Comiccon and Palais teams have developed a level of cooperation that has allowed the event to grow with each passing year and realize its full potential. Indeed, the event has occupied the Palais in its entirety since 2015.
To celebrate, guests appearing for the 10th anniversary will include legends such as Chuck Norris and David Duchovny.
