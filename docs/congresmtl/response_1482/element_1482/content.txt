                            Research, intellectual benefits and conventions: A winning alliance between the IRSST and the Palais des congrès de Montréal
                        
                        
                        

													                          
                          Press releases | 2016-11-02
                          
                          The Palais des congrès de Montréal and the Institut de recherche Robert-Sauvé en santé et en sécurité du travail (IRSST) have decided to coordinate their actions and resources in order to help promote occupational health and safety (OHS) research by attracting major national and international conventions to Montréal, and hosting them at the Palais. This new partnership is in keeping with the Palais des congrès de Montréal’s ongoing drive to build strategic alliances, and it will help boost tourism revenues and intellectual wealth for the city and Québec.
“Montréal hosts more international events1 than any other city in the Americas, and the health sciences are no stranger to this enviable position we enjoy worldwide. The Palais, the city, our Ambassadors Club and our partners work closely hand-in-hand to attract major conventions for Montréal, events that help create a wealth of knowledge scientists from here and abroad can share,” indicated Raymond Larivée, President and CEO of the Palais des congrès de Montréal. “We are proud to be associated with the IRSST, an institute that enjoys an enviable reputation in Canada and elsewhere, and whose research leadership actively contributes to promoting the city worldwide,” Larivée added.
Dr. Pavel Hamet, President of the Ambassadors Club, Marie Larue, President and CEO of the IRSST, Raymond Larivée, President and CEO of the Palais des congrès de Montréal and Hany Moustapha, Vice-President of the Ambassadors Club, at the signing of the partnership agreement.
In the 2015-2016 financial year, the Palais des congrès de Montréal hosted 24 national and international events related to healthcare and the life sciences, among the city’s most active industry sectors. These conventions, exhibitions and meetings generated over $70 million in tourism revenues, and attracted 31,000 convention-goers to Montréal, professionals who seized the opportunity to discuss knowledge advancements with colleagues from hospitals, research centres, universities and other Montréal institutions linked to health sciences.
One of the leading OHS research centres in Canada, the IRSST actively contributes to preventing work-related accidents and illnesses while also fostering worker rehabilitation. The team is made up of scientific personnel spanning researchers and professionals hailing from various disciplines such as ergonomic intervention, chemistry, sociology, engineering, demography, industrial hygiene and psychology. “This new partnership with the Palais des congrès de Montréal will make it possible for the IRSST’s scientists and the many outside researchers we collaborate with to gain more exposure locally, nationally and internationally, and to promote the IRSST’s role and influence as an OHS research centre within workplaces all across Québec. The IRSST is pleased to be associated with the Palais des congrès de Montréal and its partners in this joint effort to foster OHS research and contribute to the economic development of the city,” stated Ms. Marie Larue, President and CEO of the IRSST.
The new agreement will span various forms, including information sharing, targeting the right conventions for Montréal, and developing an IRSST-Ambassadors Club award honouring researchers who played a role in attracting international conventions for Montréal and the Palais. Since 2014, the Palais des congrès de Montréal has established partnerships with the Fonds de recherche du Québec and Montréal InVivo, in addition to setting up an Aerospace Major Events Committee.
