                          The World Design Summit will be held in Montréal in 2017. This world-class event, which will take place from October 16 to 24, will bring together over 4,500 delegates from 80 countries. Professionals from six design disciplines associated to the built environment – Architecture, Landscape Architecture, Graphic Design, Industrial Design, Interior Design and Urban Design/Planning – will get together at Montréal's Palais des congrès in order to develop an action plan and engage the international community on a variety of environmental, social, economic and cultural issues.
"The World Design Summit – Montréal 2017 is a unique opportunity to engage the decision-makers of the world in taking an active part in this huge interdisciplinary exchange event. Gathered together in one place for the first time ever, these national and international design luminaries will share their know-how and experience in order to foster the emergence of new ways to deal with such global challenges as the fight against climate change. We are inviting the international community to get actively involved and engaged in this process in order to ensure its success", declared Alain Dufour, WDSO Co-director and Summit Secretary General.
"Tourisme Montréal is thrilled to help host this first edition of the Summit in Montréal, as 2017 will mark the City's 375th anniversary and generate an influx of thousands of tourists in Québec's Metropolis. With tourism-related economic spinoffs estimated at $9M, this enabling event is a unique opportunity to strengthen the reputation of our Metropolis as a world city of design", added Yves Lalumière, CEO of Tourisme Montréal.
"The team at the Palais des congrès de Montréal is proud to host the World Design Summit in this icon of Montréal architecture, which is widely recognized for its stunning multicoloured glass façade and ranked among the "1001 Buildings You Must See Before You Die", said Raymond Larivée, CEO of the Palais des congrès de Montréal. "Having been named First destination in the Americas1 for hosting international conventions, and holder of a Gold AIPC Quality Standards certificate, Montréal and the Palais des congrès are well positioned on the world scene; we are thrilled to welcome the 4,500 delegates who are no doubt ready to live a unique experience in a dynamic and 'design' environment", added Mr. Larivée.
Furthermore, the World Design Summit recently announced the creation of a historic cooperation accord, signed by the seven most influential international organizations in the world of design.2 This accord, signed and made public as a declaration, will foster a genuine worldwide interaction movement, comprising international associations and their memberships, for the purpose of proposing effective and sustainable solutions to social, economic and environmental challenges.
The World Design Summit – Montréal 2017 is made possible by the committed involvement of a committee of partners including, amongst others, Tourisme Montréal, the Palais des congrès de Montréal, various professional bodies and associations, and government partners such as the City of Montréal.
About the World Design Summit Organization (WDSO)
The WDSO was created through a 2009 decision of the "Committee of Summit Partners". The OSMD's objectives are as follows:

Promote the exercise of quality architecture, design and urban planning/design practices as elements of innovation in the context of sustainable development and the fight against climate change.
Create a synergy conducive to the creation of economic and social development-enabling structures and bridges on a global scale.
Showcase the know-how of Canada's, Québec's and Montréal's design and related communities during the festivities marking the anniversaries of Canada (150 years), Expo '67 (50 years) and the founding of the City of Montréal (375 years).
Create strategic-watch mechanisms to anticipate major global trends and position Canadian design on the world scene.

 1 Union of international associations (UAI)
2 The seven design-related international organizations are as follows:

 International Council of Design (Ico-D)
International Federation of Landscape Architects (IFLA)
International Federation for Housing and Planning (IFHP)
International Federation of Interior designers/architects (IFI)
International Council of Societies of Industrial Design (ICSID)
Interaction Design Association (IxDA)
International Association of Universities and Colleges of Art, Design and Media - Cumulus

 The public can join the conversation on the Summit via hashtag #MTLDesign2017.
