Policy concerning privacy and the protection of personal information



                        Montréal Convention Centre strives to respect and safeguard the privacy of each User of its Web sites. This policy was developed to inform all Users of Montréal Convention Centre’s commitment to this effect. Moreover, the terms described in the Conditions of Use also apply to this policy.
This policy governs the content and operation of the Montréal Convention Centre Portal and all applications linked to any of the Portal’s sites that are available on mobile devices such as smart phones or electronic tablets (hereafter “mobile devices”) (hereafter, all of the former is individually and collectively referred to as the “Site”), as well as the authorized use of each User.
Users accept that this policy may be modified by Montréal Convention Centre at any time and without prior notice and are bound to such modifications. Therefore, it is recommended that Users regularly consult this policy to remain apprised of its applicable terms. The specifics of the policy are as follows.
1. Personal information
1.1 Collection
The Site does not include any technology that could be used to collect personal information from the User without his or her consent. Users are free to use the Site, subject to the terms contained in the General conditions governing the use of the Internet sites operated by Montréal Convention Centre and its subsidiaries.
No personal information is collected without the prior consent of the User. The only personal information that Montréal Convention Centre may collect is information that is provided voluntarily by the User when writing directly to an e-mail address found on the Site, participating in a promotion, subscribing to a service, opening an account, or by other similar means. In order to be able to provide the requested service, open an account or comply with legal requirements, Montréal Convention Centre reserves the right to request personal information or supporting documents from the User.
1.2 Use
Personal information is processed and stored in the same manner as any other direct exchange between Montréal Convention Center and its customers (by email, telephone, etc.), that is to say, in accordance with the provisions of the Act respecting Access to documents held by public bodies and the Protection of personal information, R.S.Q., c. A 2.1.
Personal information is used by Montréal Convention Center only as prescribed by law. This means that, except as prescribed by law, Montréal Convention Center will attempt to obtain the User's consent prior to making any use of information for purposes other than those for which the information was originally provided.
Personal information is accessible to Montréal Convention Center's employees, as such information is necessary to perform their duties.
1.3 Release
Montréal Convention Centre may release personal information when so required by law or by a directive from a competent authority.
Montréal Convention Center may also release personal information to service providers, including service providers located outside the Province of Québec and Canada. In such cases, Montréal Convention Centre remains responsible for the protection of the confidentiality of such information.
1.4 Conservation and Destruction
Personal information is kept by Montréal Convention Centre in accordance with Montréal Convention Centre's document retention schedule.
Montréal Convention Centre uses the appropriate security measures to ensure the protection of personal information.
Personal information is destroyed in a secure and confidential manner.
1.5 Access and Correction
All Users have the right to access their own personal information held by Montréal Convention Centre and may request in writing that incorrect, incomplete or ambiguous information be corrected. In order to access personal information held by Montréal Convention Centre, a request must be made.
2. Automatically exchanged information
Information exchanged automatically between computers cannot be used to personally identify the User. Such data is collected for the sole purpose of meeting the technical requirements of Web browsing and is used for statistical purposes only.
The User should be aware that each time he or she accesses the Site, an exchange of information takes place, automatically and without the need for intervention, between his or her computer or mobile device and Montréal Convention Centre's servers and third parties. This information in no way personally identifies the User.
The following information is exchanged:

The domain name (for instance, "company.com" if the user is using a private Internet access account, or "university.edu" if he or she is accessing the Web through a university), and the IP address (in general terms, an IP address is a unique identifier assigned to a computer or mobile device when it is linked to the Internet, which allows documents addressed to that computer to be sent without error).
The type of Web browser and operating system being used to access the Site.
The pages being consulted.
The site (referring site) from which the User has browsed, if any, in order to reach a Montréal Convention Center's Site.
If the User has already visited one of Montréal Convention Center's sites in the past few weeks, it is possible to identify the User by means of a "cookie" residing on his or her computer (see point 3).

Montréal Convention Center uses Google Analytics in its Site. Google requires that Montréal Convention Center make the information below public:
“This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses "cookies," which are text files placed on your computer to help the Web site analyze how Users use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the Web site (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Web site, compiling reports on Web site activity for Web site operators and providing other services relating to Web site activity and Internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties, and in particular the operator of this Web site, process the information on Google's behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser; however, please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this Web site. By using this Web site, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above."
This exchange of information is necessary in order for the server to send files that are compatible with the User's computer hardware. Montréal Convention Center also stores information needed to track the number of Users of the site, the most frequently accessed pages, the technology used to access Montréal Convention Center's Web sites, the referring sites, and the country of origin of Users of Montréal Convention Center's Web sites.
3. Cookies
Some of Montréal Convention Center's Web sites place permanent or temporary cookies on the User's hard disk drives. These cookies are used mainly to simplify Users' browsing experience by "remembering" their language preference. Other permanent cookies may be used, for instance, to track how many times a User returns to one of Montréal Convention Center's Web sites within a given period.
For some Montréal Convention Center Web sites to work properly, the User's browser must be set to accept cookies. However, the User can then erase these cookies from his or her computer or mobile device without affecting its ability to display Montréal Convention Center Web sites.
4. Remarketing
This site uses Google’s Remarketing service which allows Google to show our ads on sites on the internet. Google uses cookies to serve ads based on a user’s prior visits to our website. To know more about this functionality, please visit adwords.google.com. Users may opt out of Google’s use of cookies by visiting the Google advertising opt-out page.
