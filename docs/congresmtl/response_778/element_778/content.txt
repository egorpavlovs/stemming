    Great news to close out 2018 with a bang: the Palais des congrès de Montréal just confirmed the International Council of Nurses Congress is coming to Montréal in 2023!

Over 8,000 nursing specialists from all over the world are expected for this event, which will add an estimated almost $21.4 million to the Montréal and Québec economy, not to mention significant intellectual wealth. The Congress will generate nearly 22,400 room nights in hotels across the city.
We congratulate Nancy Feely of McGill University as well as Sylvie Cossette and Jacinthe Pépin of Université de Montréal for their efforts in securing this major event, and salute the remarkable work  of the Canadian Nurses Association, and the teams from the Palais des congrès de Montréal and Tourisme Montréal.
