	Big names, big crowds

	 
		communications
		Conferences, meetings and galas, Palais des congrès de Montréal
					
    
    The Palais des congrès de Montréal recently hosted some big names, which in turn drew big crowds. When the likes of Barack or Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton or the Aga Khan are in town, you can count on a sizeable audience!
Michelle Obama’s speech in February drew the biggest crowd ever assembled in one room at the Palais: 10,200 people. Nearly 12,000 people gathered to hear the Aga Khan in November.
Strategic security measures
Ensuring the safety of such high-profile speakers is naturally a top priority. The key to doing it successfully resides in the different police forces and the event organizers working together. When everyone’s needs are attended to and operations are coordinated accordingly, things unfold as planned logistically.
Crowd management
The other challenge for events like these is managing the crowd. Everyone attending must go through a security screening, have their tickets validated, and find their seats – all within a very short time span. Good communication and attentive service are essential here for the experience to be a memorable one for all participants.
The U.S. Secret Service saluted the work of the Palais security team for the security plan they drafted and deployed when the American dignitaries visited.
Each event, big or small, needs to be meticulously planned and deserves our attention so that it can live up to the expectations of those organizing it, and participating in it.

	The Palais des congrès de Montréal earns major environmental recertification

	 
		communications
		uncategorized
					
    
    The Palais des congrès de Montréal is proud to have had its BOMA BEST environmental certification renewed until 2020. This signifies that the Palais’ environmental performance and the fulfilment of its commitments have been duly recognized and certified by Canada’s largest environmental assessment and certification program.
The complexity of managing operations tied to hosting different events at different times of the day renders this recertification that much more rewarding for the Palais team. Optimizing the control of fresh air supply circulating throughout the property’s distribution system has enabled the Palais to reduce its energy consumption by almost 3%, in a building that hosts nearly 350 events a year, 900,000 visitors, and spans 1.4 million sq. ft.
A commitment entrenched in business practices
Responsible, determined and committed, the Palais des congrès de Montréal became, in 2005, one of the first convention centres in Canada to be BOMA BEST certified. The Sustainability Action Plan and Sustainable Development Policy at the core of its strategy are ensuring the viability of its commitment. Also, the Responsible Procurement Policy it recently adopted is raising awareness among the Palais’ staff, partners and suppliers about the importance of consuming, producing and purchasing responsibly.
An urban farming lab as a form of green roofing
When the Palais des congrès de Montréal opened its Urban Agriculture Lab in 2016, in collaboration with AU/Lab, an organization associated with the faculty of science and the institute of environmental science of the Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM), it became the main showcase in Québec for experimenting with and advocating for urban farming technologies and techniques.
A certifiably green host destination
Montréal and the Palais are ASTM-APEX certified (Accepted Practices Exchange) as a green convention site.

	It’s about furnishing an experience

		Hi-tech environment, Palais des congrès de Montréal
					
    
    A convention centre’s entrance halls and atria, pre-function spaces and corridors are an integral part of the event spaces, but sometimes they just look and feel… rudimentary. Not at the Palais des congrès de Montréal, where we dress and configure them to enrich the experience for participants and also optimize the flow and productivity of the event.
In February 2018, we outfitted the various common areas spanning levels 5 and 7 of the Palais with new furnishings to foster interaction, networking and comfort during breaks for both the delegates and organizers of the event.
Modern, colourful and functional, the items include communal tables equipped with power outlets, privacy armchairs, ottomans and benches to promote wellbeing, meetings or teleworking.
Take a few minutes to rest and use the solar energy to refuel before your next conference!

	Seizing on Montréal’s expertise to predict the social impacts of Artificial Intelligence

	 
		communications
		Conventions, Sectors of excellence
					
    
    On March 27, 2018, the Fonds de recherche du Québec, in partnership with Université de Montréal, held a workshop at the Palais des congrès de Montréal on a project to create a world observatory on the social impacts of artificial intelligence (AI) and digital technologies. Nearly one hundred people from all of Québec’s universities were in attendance, along with representatives from government departments, civil society organizations and the AI sector.
According to the workshop organizers, all activity sectors are going to be increasingly affected by artificial intelligence. While it holds extraordinary potential to foster economic development and improve living conditions, AI also raises concerns with regard to jobs, security, democracy, ethics and the professional, social and private spheres of our lives; hence the idea to create an observatory on these social issues.
Held in November 2017, the workshop was as a follow-up to the Forum on the Socially Responsible Development of Artificial Intelligence and jointly organized with the Palais des congrès. By bringing together experts from fields ranging from pure science to the humanities and social sciences, the Forum sparked a collective discussion on the ethical and socially responsible development of AI.

The Palais des congrès de Montréal recently confirmed it will be hosting yet another major AI convention, more evidence of just how dynamically this scientific field is developing in the city. The 30th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI) will be coming in 2021 and attract nearly 3,000 experts from all over the world.

    The 2018 Expo Manger Santé et Vivre Vert consumer show was a resounding success, drawing 25,000 visitors. Since 2002, lovers of healthy and natural food have been converging on the Palais every year to discover the products featured at the show.
Buoyed by last weekend’s turnout, the Expo and Palais teams are now busy performing their post-event review to plan for next year’s edition, and the even higher number of visitors it will inevitably attract.
