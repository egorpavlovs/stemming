                          The Palais des congrès de Montréal, its Ambassadors Club and the Fonds de recherche du Québec further bolstered their partnership, whose aim is to promote Québec scientific research by attracting international conventions to Montréal. The agreement, which runs until 2019, fosters closer cooperation between the scientific community and the Palais des congrès in order to bring more major conferences to Montréal – events that will generate both intellectual wealth and tourism revenue that will benefit the entire community.

Montréal is known globally as a knowledge hub thanks its world class researchers, universities and research centres. “Their involvement is invaluable to the process of bringing an international convention to Montréal. It shows international decision-makers the dynamic spirit and support that exists within the city’s key economic sectors,” says Raymond Larivée, President and CEO of the Palais des congrès de Montréal, a Québec government corporation. “Conventions represent a privileged opportunity to exchange with our peers from all over the world, and they help push the boundaries of knowledge for our industries. These intellectual benefits greatly contribute to Montréal’s international reputation,” adds Professor Hany Moustapha, President of the Ambassadors Club.
“It is important for researchers to get involved in organizing international scientific conferences. Those who’ve done it know that although it demands a lot of time, the benefits to their research career is invaluable. Which is why the Fonds de recherche du Québec are proud of this partnership, and also that the competition recognizing the work of researchers in organizing big scientific conferences will continue to thrive,” points out Rémi Quirion, Québec’s Chief Scientist.
Annual grants
Among the terms of the partnership is the awarding of the Prix du Club des Ambassadeurs du Palais des congrès de Montréal et des Fonds de recherche du Québec, grants recognizing the work of researchers invested in organizing international scientific conventions. The first recipients were announced in November 2016, during the Fonds de recherche du Québec forum organized annually by the partners. They are:

Gaétan Laroche and Diego Mantovani of Université Laval, in collaboration with Sophie Lerouge of the ETS school of engineering, for the 10th World Biomaterials Congress
Grant presented by the Fonds de recherche – Nature et technologies
Jean-Marie Dufour of McGill University, for the 11th World Congress of the Econometric Society
Grant presented by the Fonds de recherche – Société et culture
Pierre Talbot of INRS-Institut Armand-Frappier, for the International Congress of Microbiology
Grant presented by the Fonds de recherche – Santé

Promoting science by hosting international conferences
The three-year agreement is also focused on actions aimed at shining the spotlight on the research of those who invest themselves in winning and organizing an international convention in their field. Through their cooperation, the Fonds de recherche du Québec and the Palais des congrès de Montréal make sure the economic and intellectual benefits for Montréal and the province are maximized.
