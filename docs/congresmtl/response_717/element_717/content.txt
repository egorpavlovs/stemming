    During the first edition of a forum on promoting Québec research, the President and CEO of the Palais seized this inaugural forum to announce the creation of a fund that will assist researchers looking to get involved in holding an international convention at the Palais. The $25,000 fund, which will be jointly administered by the Fonds de recherche du Québec and the Palais Ambassadors Club, will make it possible to support some of the essential needs that are part of the process of bidding for major international events and bringing them to the Palais.
It is an opportunity for the two organizations to help showcase and position Montréal as a premier host city for big scientific conventions, and in the process also encourage researchers to get involved in organizing international events.
“Supporting researchers proactively by giving them tools to organize and host major international events makes it possible to shine the spotlight on local expertise while also generating significant intellectual and economic benefits for Montréal and Québec,” stated Raymond Larivée, President and CEO of the Palais des congrès de Montréal, a Québec government corporation. “Montréal is known globally as a knowledge hub thanks its world class researchers, universities and research centres. By supporting these leading lights from our city’s key economic sectors, the whole province gains international recognition,” he added.
Rémi Quirion, Chief Scientist of Québec, also declared: “It is important that we spur our researchers and student researchers to get involved in organizing major international conventions. There’s an entrepreneurial facet here that we need to encourage, especially given the benefits the scientific community can reap from it, and all of Québec as well. We must seize opportunities to lead when it comes to major scientific conventions, whether in the life sciences sector, natural sciences, engineering, social sciences, the humanities, arts and literature. The cross-sector aspect must be factored into the planning of big scientific conventions, and public participation as well. And we need to include students in the process to pique their interest in organizing a scientific event of their own later in their careers.”
