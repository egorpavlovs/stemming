    Beginning this fall through spring 2015, the Palais rolls out an annual consumer tradeshow calendar that offers something for every interest. From soon-to-be brides and grooms to sci-fi fans and automobile enthusiasts to fashion and beauty trendseekers, everyone will find their niche.
At the heart of downtown Montréal and directly linked to the métro (subway), the Palais offers more than 1600 parking spaces for visitors and exhibitors. In other words, it’s really easy to access! Take a peek at the upcoming consumer trade shows and join close to half a million people who come to discover the latest products and trends at the Palais:
Montréal Comiccon: September 12 to 14, 2014 – Geek alert! The entire cast of Star Trek: The Next Generation, guests of Honor George A. Romero (Night of the Living Dead), Matt Smith (Doctor Who) and Hulk Hogan (WWE Legend) and tons of other sci-fi and fantasy stars were part of  the show. Celebrity Q&As, photo ops, panels and workshops and more: the ultimate fandom experience!

Weekend De toute beauté: November 7 to 10, 2014 – Get your glam going and get a chance to chat with top make-up artists, hairdressers, designers and stylists at this major beauty event. Participants can browse fashion and accessories, attend conferences, pick up tips and tricks and learn new techniques—absolutely everything to get them feeling confident, cool and chic.
The Nutcracker Market: November 27 to December 7, 2014 – A non-profit Christmas market that offers a gift-giving paradise. Ten percent of the merchant’s pre-tax sales and all revenues earned go to the Nutcracker Fund For Children. From home decorating to gourmet goodies and everything in between, shoppers will find a treasure trove of tasteful and original gifts to kick off the holiday season.

The Montréal International Auto Show: January 16 to 25, 2015 – Just about every auto maker under the sun will be at the Palais, showing off their latest and greatest. And, yes, you can buy a car on the premises. A bonanza for automobile enthusiasts!
Le Salon de la Mariée: January 31 and February 1, 2015 – The 32th edition of this event is the place to be for anyone about to say, “I do”. Men and women who will be walking down the aisle can talk to wedding professionals, discover the latest trends, sample products, win prizes and get a bouquet of fantastic ideas for their big day.

The 2015 Montreal Motorcycle Show: February 27 to March 1, 2015 – All the major manufacturers, from Harley-Davidson to Honda to Husaberg, will rock the Palais! New models, riding accessories, trial demonstrations and more for motorcycle mavens.
This is just a sampling of all the fun going on at the Palais. For a full view of what’s happening year-round, go to the Palais website. Enjoy another great season of inspiration and fun!
