                          Quarterly Report – October 1 to December 31, 2014
For the quarter ending December 31, 2014, the Société du Palais des congrès de Montréal confirmed 7 conventions and 8 tradeshows that will generate a future influx of 26,000 business tourists to Montréal, and an estimated nearly $35.4 million for the city’s economy. These events, secured with the collaboration of Tourisme Montréal and Palais Ambassadors, will translate into nearly 15,500 room nights for Montréal’s hotels. Overall, 84 events were confirmed during the third quarter of 2014-2015, which is comparable to last year for the same period.
The Palais des congrès predicts that 2014-15 will be marked by 2 significant outcomes:

The holding of 75 conventions and tradeshows — A new record


The hosting of 196,000 participating business tourists including 127,000 convention-goers — 28% more than the average for the last 5 years

“By generating nearly $247,000,000 for Montréal’s and Québec’s economy by year’s end, as we are projecting, the Palais des congrès de Montréal is actively, and proudly, contributing to the province’s economic development,” says Raymond Larivée, President and CEO of the Palais des congrès. “The coming 2015-16 year will also be an opportunity to keep the momentum going by generating even more economic benefits,” adds Larivée.
Among the large-scale events hosted during the quarter, 13 were conventions and 9 were tradeshows, for a total of almost 53,000 business tourists who generated an estimated $62,000,000 for Montréal’s and Québec’s economy. These business tourism generating events accounted for 27,715 room nights being booked in hotels across the city.
