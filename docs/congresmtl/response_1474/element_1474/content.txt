                          Quarterly Report – October 1 to December 31, 2015
For the quarter ending December 31, 2015, the Société du Palais des congrès de Montréal confirmed six international1 conventions, three national2 conventions and several major tradeshows to be held in the future, representing a combined increase of 23% over the same period last year for conventions and tradeshows. The conventions, secured with the collaboration of Tourisme Montréal, and the tradeshows will attract almost 30,500 business tourists to Montréal – up 51% over the same quarter of 2014-15 – who will book nearly 51,000 room nights in hotels across the city, which is four times higher than for the same period last year.
The average square footage for these events confirmed by the Business Development and Strategic Alliances team will be significantly higher compared to 2014-15, with conventions booking 65% more space on average and tradeshows, 97% more. Overall, these business-tourism-generating events will result in economic benefits estimated at nearly $53 million, or $21 million more than for the same period last year. The quarter also saw the Montréal International Auto Show sign a new four-year extension with the Palais.
“The increase in the average amount of space being booked for future conventions and tradeshows reflects the hard work being focused on attracting large-scale events to the Palais, and also speaks to the industry’s interest in Montréal and the Palais,” declared Raymond Larivée, President and CEO of the Palais des congrès de Montréal. “It is an outcome made possible by the cooperation that exists between the Palais des congrès de Montréal, Tourisme Montréal, the Hotel Association of Greater Montréal and other tourism and convention industry partners,” he added.
Among the large-scale events hosted during the quarter, 10 were conventions and 10 were trade shows. These accounted for an estimated $67+ million in economic benefits. The events helped draw several thousand participants to Montréal during the quarter, and they included: the CHEST Annual Meeting 2015, NIPS 2015, Canadian Waste & Recycling Expo 2015, Stratégies PME 2016, the Nutcracker Market and the Salon Ma carrière, emploi et formation professionnelle.
