		Exhibitions and tradeshows
					
    
    The next Montréal Outdoor, Hunting, Fishing and Camping Show will be the 58th edition—and the first to be held at the Palais des congrès de Montréal. It will run from February 14 to 17, 2019.
Year after year, this show offers a full spectrum of great outdoor activities and continues to transmit the passion for nature to many new visitors.
The Palais is very pleased to be hosting this popular consumer show and our team eagerly looks forward to welcoming outdoor lovers to their annual event.
