															Big names, big crowds
															
														
														
															
															The Palais des congrès de Montréal recently hosted some big names, which in turn drew big crowds. When the likes of Barack or Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton or the Aga Khan are in town, you can count on a sizeable audience! Michelle Obama’s speech in February drew the biggest crowd ever assembled in one room at the Palais: 10,200 people.

															It’s about furnishing an experience
															
														
														
															
															A convention centre’s entrance halls and atria, pre-function spaces and corridors are an integral part of the event spaces, but sometimes they just look and feel… rudimentary. Not at the Palais des congrès de Montréal, where we dress and configure them to enrich the experience for participants and also optimize the flow and productivity of the event.
