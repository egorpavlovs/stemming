    President of the Ambassadors Club since 2010 and a member since Day One, Dr. Pavel Hamet is stepping down as head of the prestigious group of now 300+ Ambassadors.
Focused on youth
Throughout his term, Dr. Hamet actively worked to position Montréal as a prime host city for international conventions, mostly by setting in motion two Club-driven action plans and developing a partnership between the Palais and the Fonds de recherche du Québec. Tirelessly committed to the Ambassadors of tomorrow, Pavel Hamet is the brainchild behind the Rendez-Vous du Savoir knowledge forums that ran from 2010 to 2012, and its star student researcher competition.
Emeritus Ambassador
Dr. Hamet was appointed Ambassador in the Club’s first year, in 1985, after bringing the 13th annual meeting of the International Society of Hypertension to Montréal. In 2010, he was also on the organizing committee of the 6th International Congress of the Society of Pathophysiology. And in 2016, he helped put in place the world’s very first International Congress on Personalized Health Care, which earned him the appointment of Emeritus Ambassador.
World renowned researcher
Pavel Hamet is recognized worldwide for his contribution to hypertension treatments, diabetes research and personalized health care in Québec. His research gained widespread recognition and earned him numerous prestigious awards, including being named an Officer of the National Order of Québec and winning the International Okamoto Award, a Japanese prize given to researchers for their remarkable contribution to cardiovascular diseases, like hypertension, atherosclerosis and diabetes.
Dr. Hamet founded and headed the research centre of the Centre hospitalier de l’Université de Montréal (CHUM) from 1990 to 2006. Full professor at the Université de Montréal’s faculty of medicine, he is also the Director of the Ecogenomic Platform for Complex Diseases and Chief of Gene Medicine at the CHUM, and the Canada Research Chair in Predictive Genomics.
