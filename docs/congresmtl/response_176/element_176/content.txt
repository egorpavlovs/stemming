                            Level 2
                        

                        
The second level is designed to host a plethora of events



                        Elegant and spacious
The second floor is 263,000 sq. ft. (24,000 m²) and can host a multitude of activities, especially large exhibitions. A 50,000 sq. ft. (4,645 m²) columnless hall is perfect for expositions and receptions for up to 600 people while sophisticated Hall Viger can add a touch of elegance to any type of activity.
Hall Viger and the Esplanade
Hall Viger can welcome 1,250 persons or 35 booths on its 21,400 sq. ft. surface (1,992 m²). Access to the Esplanade from here means you’re not more than a few steps away from a refreshing and calming breath of air amid pretty crab apple trees and a view of historic Chinatown.
Essential services
A cloakroom is available, so are an indoor waiting area capable of accommodating 10 53-foot trailer trucks and 15 unloading docks with access ramps. Freight elevators, forklifts and storage space are also onsite to help set up activities, as are state-of-the-art telecommunications services and soundproof panels.
