After embracing sustainability over 10 years ago, the Palais has now taken its commitment to an even higher level by converting its rooftop into green spaces. The transformation began in 2010, and it's a win-win situation for the environment and the Palais' users who will now have a new and original space for their events.
										
                              

The Palais is in the process of adding plantlife, vegetable gardens, rest areas and an event areas to nearly 150,000 sq. ft. of its rooftop, an endeavour that is sure to further entrench its position as a leader among convention centres.

"We've always been serious about our commitment to sustainability," says Marc Tremblay, President and CEO of the Palais. "Developping a green roof is simply another step, as is the current makeover of our program aimed at helping customers organize greener events. Sure our approach is bold, but realistic nevertheless."

The experiment actually began last year, when a delighted Wahed Naja, executive chef of Capital Traiteur, the Palais' exclusive caterer, grew 138 tomato plants atop the roof, which yielded 90 kg of tomatoes of three different varieties. A sizable harvest for an inaugural foray into urban farming…


The Palais continues to be fertile ground for sustainable ideas. It's been operating since 2010 a rooftop terrace furnished with a tent. Every effort is made to turn bold challenges into reality when it comes to energy efficiency, planning green events and redefining the use of roofs. 

On a related note, the list of green events being hosted at the Palais keeps growing. Upcoming events include the 2011 Ecocity World Summit from August 22 to 26, which is expected to attract nearly 1,500 people. The theme will be People. Ecology. Urbanity. Moving Towards Ecocities.
