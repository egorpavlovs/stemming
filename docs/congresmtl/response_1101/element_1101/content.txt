    Major international organizations have long made Montréal their home – they are over 60 based here, making the city the largest international organization community in North America, after Washington, D.C., and New York City. The city’s drawing power was confirmed once more when AIESEC announced it had picked Montréal for its international secretariat.

AIESEC, one of the largest associations in the world with 50,000 students and recent graduate members, is a global platform that encourages young people to explore and develop their leadership potential. Formerly an acronym, AIESEC (pronounced eye-sek) is now the organization’s official full name.
“Montréal stands out due to its strategic location, economic stability, competitive cost of living and safe urban environment. What’s more, Montréal is home to a large and vibrant student community. The city’s got everything we need to fulfill our mission,” declared Niels Caszo, President of AIESEC International 2016-17.
Thanks to its 11 higher learning establishments, including 6 universities, Montréal is a bona fide knowledge hub. Which explains why Montréal took top spot in the 2017 QS Best Student City rankings.
“We are delighted that AIESEC chose Montréal and we would like to thank the 30 organizations that helped with the city’s bid, particularly student groups and educational institutions, as well as youth organizations and private sector businesses,” said Hubert Bolduc, President and CEO of Montréal International. “Our partners’ engagement and ability to work together were decisive factors in AIESEC’s choice, providing a glimpse of the full business potential the organization can tap into to grow and strengthen its position across the world,” he added.
