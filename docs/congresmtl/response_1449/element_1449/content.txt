                          Positive annual results for Montréal business tourism leader
The Palais des congrès de Montréal had a very busy year, hosting 360 events, and coming really close to equalling its best record ever. It’s an 8% increase over the same period last year. The events generated over $181 million in business revenue for Montréal and Québec, and brought 835,000 convention-goers and participants to the city, despite the last-minute cancellation of two major events, including the World Police and Fire Games. The conventions drew an average of nearly 3,000 people, up almost 10% compared to the average for the last 5 years. These figures clearly speak to the appeal of Montréal as a professional meeting place for convention-goers from all over the world.
The Business Development team confirmed 17% more events this year than it did in 2016-17, which represents a significant increase. Totalling 388 overall, and slated for the coming months and years, these events are expected to attract an estimated 1.1 million convention-goers and participants, who will generate nearly $235 million in tourism revenue. Many conventions were secured thanks to the collaboration of city partners, especially Tourisme Montréal.
“2017-2018 was unquestionably a very good year for the Palais, shattering records on several fronts, including customer satisfaction rate, own-source revenues, average attendance for conventions, etc.,” declared Raymond Larivée, President and CEO of the Palais des congrès de Montréal. “Montréal hosts more international conventions than any other city in North America, and we fully intend to continue to play an active role in maintaining that standing for the province,” he added.
Dynamic local market
While hosting a steady number of conventions throughout the year, the Palais held 270 short-term events, such as conferences, meetings and galas, up 15% over last year. These special events drew a total of 176,000+ people, representing an increase of 14% compared to 2016-17.
Hosting major conventions
2017-2018 also accounted for 36 national and international conventions, many of which were large-scale events.

Satisfied customers
The Palais des congrès team, together with its official and exclusive suppliers, continued to rate favourably in terms of customer satisfaction. The efforts paid off, translating into an overall satisfaction rate of nearly 90% – a record high that reflects the remarkable work of the Palais teams and the excellent cooperation of the following partners: Capital Catering, Freeman Canada and GES.
Own-source revenue on the rise
A Québec government corporation, the Palais rolled out several new strategies these past years to increase its own-source revenue. Thanks to the creativity and passion of its entire workforce, the Palais posted remarkable results, setting a record since opening in 1983.
Convention city
Montréal hosts more international events than any other city in North America, according to the rankings released by the International Congress and Convention Association. Shortlisted for the World’s Best Congress Centre award (AIPC) in 2018 and the recipient of the highest quality standards certification in the industry, the Palais des congrès de Montréal has all the necessary assets to host a major convention with the level of professionalism and creativity the city is known for. Winner of the APEX Innovation Award in 2017, the Palais continues to be a leading authority in the industry, as it has been for 35 years.
