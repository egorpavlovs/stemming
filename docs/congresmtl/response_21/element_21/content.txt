                        Since it opened in 1983, the Palais des congrès de Montréal has built a reputation for excellence spanning the globe. After more than 7,700 events and 19 million visitors, we can safely say that we have developed an unparalleled level of expertise in the industry.
Each event is relentlessly planned, coordinated and monitored. During the event itself, dozens of professionals are assigned to handling every detail, looking after the comfort and satisfaction of visitors, and anticipating the unexpected. Our team gets passionate about the events we host at the Palais, and is driven to ensure a successful outcome every time.
Located in Montréal’s downtown core, the Palais is a safe and bustling venue. A hub of activity straddling the city’s business centre, international district, Old Montréal and Chinatown, it is near Montréal’s main attractions, and also less than ten minutes from 16 000 hotel rooms, 4 000 of which are directly linked to the Palais via the underground pedestrian network.
Inside, the Palais is trendy, generously lit, and welcoming. The venue is ultra-functional and capable of handling events of every size. The customer service is incomparable. Hence why more and more event planners and promoters are holding their national and international events at the Palais!
