[[File:Model of stadium at Leopoldstrasse.JPG|thumb|Model of Bayern's first stadium, their home from 1906 to 1924]]

Bayern played its first training games at the Schyrenplatz in the centre of [[Munich]]. The first official games were held on the [[Theresienwiese]]. In 1901, Bayern moved to a field of its own, located in [[Schwabing]] at the [[Clemensstraße]]. After joining the Münchner Sport-Club (MSC) in 1906, Bayern moved in May 1907 to MSC's ground at the Leopoldstraße.<ref>{{cite book

It was destroyed during the war, and efforts to rebuild it resulted in a patchwork. Bayern's record crowd at the Grünwalder Stadion is reported as more than 50,000 in the home game against [[1. FC Nürnberg]] in the [[1961–62 Oberliga|1961–62]] season.<ref>{{cite book

As was the case at most of this period's stadiums, the vast majority of the stadium was given over to terracing. Today the second teams of both clubs play in the stadium.<ref>{{cite web|title=Das Grünwalder Stadion |publisher=FC Bayern Munich Official Website |accessdate=11 August 2008 |year=2005 |url=http://www.fcbayern.t-home.de/de/verein/ag/stadion/gruenwalder/ |language=German |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221215657/http://www.fcbayern.t-home.de/de/verein/ag/stadion/gruenwalder/ |archivedate=21 December 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Sportliche Höhepunkte in der Geschichte des Sechz'gers | publisher = Freunde des Sechz'ger Stadions e.V. | accessdate = 14 July 2008 | year = 2007 | url = http://www.gruenwalder-stadion.de/?id=43 | language = German | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080922055934/http://www.gruenwalder-stadion.de/?id=43 | archivedate = 22 September 2008 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>

The stadium was, in its early days, considered to be one of the foremost stadiums in the world and played host to numerous major finals, such as that of [[1974 FIFA World Cup]].<ref>{{cite web | title = The Olympic Stadium&nbsp;– Event Highlights | accessdate = 12 July 2008 | date = 31 December 2007 | publisher = Olympiapark München GmbH | url = http://www.olympiapark-muenchen.de/index.php?id=hoehepunkte_olystad | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090207062452/http://www.olympiapark-muenchen.de/index.php?id=hoehepunkte_olystad | archivedate = 7 February 2009 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> In the following years the stadium underwent several modifications, such as an increase in seating space from approximately 50% to ca. 66%.{{clarify|date=April 2014}} Eventually, the stadium had a capacity of 63,000 for national matches and 59,000 for international occasions such as European Cup competitions. Many people, however, began to feel that the stadium was too cold in winter, with half the audience exposed to the weather due to lack of cover. A further complaint was the distance between the spectators and the pitch, betraying the stadium's track and field heritage. Renovation proved impossible, as the architect [[Günther Behnisch]] vetoed major modifications of the stadium.<ref name = "diebayern_allianzarena">{{cite book

[[File:Allianz arena at night Richard Bartz.jpg|thumb|[[Allianz Arena]] is lit in red for Bayern home games]]

After much discussion, the city of Munich, the state of [[Bavaria]], Bayern Munich and [[TSV 1860 Munich|1860 Munich]] jointly decided at the end of 2000 to build a new stadium. While Bayern had wanted a purpose-built football stadium for several years, the awarding of the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] to Germany stimulated the discussion as the Olympiastadion no longer met the [[FIFA]] criteria to host a World Cup game. Located on the northern outskirts of Munich, the [[Allianz Arena]] has been in use since the beginning of the [[2005–06 Bundesliga|2005–06]] season.<ref name = "diebayern_allianzarena" /> Its initial capacity of 66,000 fully covered seats has since been increased for matches on national level to 69,901 by transforming 3,000 seats to terracing in a 2:1 ratio.<ref>{{cite web | title = General information about the Allianz Arena | accessdate = 12 July 2008 | year = 2007 | publisher = Allianz Arena München Stadion GmbH | url = http://www.allianz-arena.de/en/fakten/allgemeine-informationen/ | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080529011548/http://www.allianz-arena.de/en/fakten/allgemeine-informationen/ | archivedate = 29 May 2008 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> Since August 2012, 2,000 more seats were added in the last row of the top tier increasing the capacity to 71,000.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fcbayern.de/de/news/news/2012/36638.php | title = Zuschauer-Kapazität der Allianz Arena erhöht | trans-title = Allianz Arena capacity increased | publisher = FC Bayern Munich | date = 29 August 2012 | language = de | accessdate = 28 September 2014 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141109065800/http://www.fcbayern.de/de/news/news/2012/36638.php | archivedate = 9 November 2014 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> In January 2015, a proposal to increase the capacity was approved by the city council so now Allianz Arena has a capacity of 75,000 (70,000 in Champions League).<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fcbayern.de/de/news/news/2015/ab-sofort-75-000-fans-bei-bundesliga-heimspielen-genehmigung-130115.php | title = AB SOFORT 75.000 FANS BEI BUNDESLIGA-HEIMSPIELEN | trans-title = From now 75000 fans at the Bundesliga games | publisher = FC Bayern Munich | date = 13 January 2015 | language = de | accessdate = 13 January 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150113190119/http://www.fcbayern.de/de/news/news/2015/ab-sofort-75-000-fans-bei-bundesliga-heimspielen-genehmigung-130115.php | archivedate = 13 January 2015 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>

The most prominent feature of the stadium is the translucent outer layer, which can be illuminated in different colours for impressive effects. Red lighting is used for Bayern home games and white for [[Germany national football team|German national team]] home games.<ref>{{cite book
