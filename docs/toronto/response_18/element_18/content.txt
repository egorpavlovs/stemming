        Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA)
        Canada has introduced a new entry requirement, known as an eTA, for visa-exempt foreign nationals travelling to Canada by air. Exceptions include U.S. citizens and travellers with a valid visa. Entry requirements for other methods of travel (land, sea) have not changed.
       
        Starting August 1, 2015, eligible travellers can apply online for an eTA. On March 15, 2016, this entry requirement will become mandatory and travellers will need an eTA before they can board a flight to Canada.
        Find out more about Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA).

Borders & Customs
Canada has one of the most advanced customs organizations in the world and our borders and the processes we have in place to manage them are critical to our ability to provide Canadians and visitors to Canada with the security and opportunity they expect. Visitors entering Canada must clear Canada Customs border security upon entry.

Entry Into Canada
When you enter Canada, a Canada Border Services Agency officer may ask to see your passport and a valid visa, if one is necessary. For information about documentation required and border procedures please visit the Canada Border Services Agency’s website.

Meeting and Convention Attendees: You may be asked for proof that you are attending a meeting or convention and it may be useful to have a copy of the meeting agenda and/or registration on hand. This may also be useful when returning to the U.S. should a similar question be asked.

Bringing Children Into Canada
Children 15 years of age and under are now required to show proof of citizenship (a certified copy of their birth certificate is acceptable). They are not required to show photo ID. If you are travelling with children, you should carry identification for each child.

Divorced parents who share custody of their children should carry copies of the legal custody documents. Adults who are not parents or guardians should have written permission from the parents or guardians to supervise the children. When travelling with a group of vehicles, parents or guardians should travel in the same vehicle as the children when arriving at the border. Customs officers are looking for missing children and may ask questions about the children who are travelling with you.

Returning to the United States
Depending on the length of stay, U.S. citizens are entitled to take goods back to the U.S. duty free. For information on U.S. customs regulations, please visit CBP.gov.
