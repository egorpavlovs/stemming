History


	First settled more than 11,000 years ago, the area that now makes up Toronto was home to a wide array of Aboriginal groups for centuries.
    The British established a settlement and fort in the late 1700’s, calling the settlement York. The Battle of York was a key battle in the War of 1812 and left the fledgling town badly damaged. In 1834 the city was incorporated and named Toronto.
    Over two centuries Toronto has attracted large waves of immigration from Europe, Latin America, Asia and Africa. In the early 1980s, on the strength of sustained immigration, it surpassed Montreal as Canada’s largest city.
